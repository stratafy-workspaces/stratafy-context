# Moat redefined: Operational lock-in, not data lock-in

## Summary
The moat isn't data lock-in (exportable). It's operational lock-in. When the org runs on Stratafy at every level, switching means changing how the company works. That's the real defensibility.

## Description
The real moat isn't data lock-in (data can be exported). It's operational lock-in. Once an organization has: Founder using Advisor daily, Board getting updates via Interface, Managers coaching teams with Coach, ICs understanding work through Guide — switching means changing how the company operates, not just migrating data. The way work happens is built on Stratafy. That's defensible against anyone, including AI giants.

# Constraints create coherence — adding limits is more valuable than adding features

## Summary
Most impactful updates were constraints, not capabilities. "We do NOT..." statements force coherence. Features add complexity; constraints create clarity.

## Description
The most impactful strategy updates weren't adding capabilities — they were adding constraints. Examples: "We do NOT ship without visible reasoning," "We do NOT let messaging outpace product," "We do NOT claim category before problem education." Constraints create coherence by forcing tradeoffs. Features create complexity by adding options. Strategic clarity comes from what you won't do.

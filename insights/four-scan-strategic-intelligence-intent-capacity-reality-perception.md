# Four-Scan Strategic Intelligence: Intent, Capacity, Reality, Perception

## Summary
Alignment Scan (intent), Organigram Scan (capacity), Radar Scan (reality), and Public Narrative Scan (perception) together form a complete continuous strategic intelligence system. Three inward-facing scans plus one outward-facing scan — each enriches the others in a compounding flywheel.

## Description
Four scans together form the complete strategic intelligence picture:

1. Alignment Scan — checks whether strategy is internally coherent. Does what you're doing connect to who you say you are? This is the INTENT layer.

2. Organigram Scan — checks whether people and work are structured to deliver on strategy. Are the right roles, teams, projects, and tasks mapped to strategic priorities? This is the CAPACITY layer.

3. Radar Scan — checks whether the external environment still supports the assumptions strategy is built on. This is the REALITY layer.

4. Public Narrative Scan — checks whether the organization's public persona (website, LinkedIn, job postings, press, messaging) aligns with actual strategy. This is the PERCEPTION layer.

The first three are inward-facing intelligence. The fourth closes the loop outward — it doesn't matter if you're aligned, capable, and oriented to reality if the market sees you as something entirely different.

THE COMPOUNDING EFFECT: Each scan enriches the others. A radar finding about a competitor becomes actionable when you can check org capacity to respond. A public narrative gap becomes urgent when the organigram shows you've already pivoted but haven't updated external messaging. Perception drift detected by the public scan can reveal strategy drift the alignment scan hasn't caught yet.

CATEGORY IMPLICATION: We're selling continuous strategic intelligence across four dimensions — the nervous system that tells an organization whether it's aligned, capable, oriented to reality, and perceived correctly. No other tool does this.

Positioning: Intent + Capacity + Reality + Perception = Complete Strategic Intelligence.

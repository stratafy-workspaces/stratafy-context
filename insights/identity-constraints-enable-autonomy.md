# Identity Constraints Enable Autonomy

## Summary
Agents need identity boundaries (SOUL.md) to be predictable. Constraints aren't limitations — they're what allow trust and delegation. Governance enables autonomy rather than restricting it.

## Description
Each agent has a SOUL.md defining who they are, what they do, and what they don't do. Without these boundaries, agents are unpredictable and can't be trusted with autonomy.

Implication for Stratafy: AI governance isn't bureaucratic overhead — it's what makes autonomy possible. Constraints = trust = more delegation. Reframe governance as enabler, not limiter. This is a key messaging shift for positioning.

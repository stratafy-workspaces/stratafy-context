# Agent roles mirror organizational hierarchy naturally

## Summary
Four agents naturally stratified into orchestrator (Chief), creator (Blog Writer), reviewer (Content Reviewer), and automator (Demo Prep). Permission levels map to organizational roles — the AI Operations Stack pattern is emerging from real use, not theory.

## Description
The agent architecture naturally stratified into four distinct roles during conversation: Chief (orchestrator, full access), Blog Writer (content creation, analyst permissions), Content Reviewer (quality gate, read-only), and Demo Prep Agent (pipeline automation, full access). This mirrors how human teams organize — different roles, different access, different purposes. The permission model (agent_full, agent_analyst, agent_readonly) maps cleanly to organizational hierarchy. This is the AI Operations Stack pattern emerging organically: not designed top-down, but discovered through actual operational needs.

# Concrete beats abstract — strategies need names, events, and deadlines

## Summary
Strategy gets real when tied to specific people, specific events, and specific deadlines. Abstract strategies drift; concrete ones execute.

## Description
The co-founder strategy became real when tied to a specific person (Ignatius), a specific event (Troop all-hands in mid-February), and a specific deadline (April decision point). Abstract strategies like "find a co-founder" drift; concrete strategies with names, triggers, and deadlines execute. Apply this pattern to all strategies: Who specifically? What event triggers action? When is the decision point?

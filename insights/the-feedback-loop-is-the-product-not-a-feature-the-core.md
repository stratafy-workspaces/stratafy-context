# The feedback loop IS the product — not a feature, the core

## Summary
Three components: continuous capture + AI analysis + human approval. This loop isn't a feature — it's the entire value proposition. Everything else exists to make it work.

## Description
The feedback loop just demonstrated has three components working together:

1. **Continuous capture** — Insights recorded as they emerge in conversation, not retrospectively compiled
2. **AI analysis** — Patterns detected, implications surfaced, recommendations generated automatically
3. **Human approval** — User remains in control, AI proposes but doesn't impose

This is the Strategic Advisor workflow applied to strategy governance itself. The same pattern that creates strategies also maintains them.

Key realization: The loop IS the product. Not a feature of the product — the core value proposition. Everything else (Foundation, Strategy, Initiatives, Alignment Scan) exists to make this loop work.

Implication: Product roadmap should prioritize loop quality over feature breadth. A smooth, reliable loop beats more features.

# Market validation: Companies executing faster but struggling to scale alignment

## Summary
Investor observation: companies executing faster than ever but struggling to manage scaling. Speed up, alignment infrastructure not keeping pace. Validates Stratafy thesis.

## Description
From investor roleplay with Roelof (Sequoia): Companies are executing faster than ever (AI tools, leaner teams, velocity culture mainstream), but struggling with how to manage scaling. Speed is increasing; scaling infrastructure is not keeping pace. This validates Stratafy's core thesis: velocity without alignment infrastructure creates chaos at scale. The problem isn't speed — it's that management systems haven't evolved to match execution speed.

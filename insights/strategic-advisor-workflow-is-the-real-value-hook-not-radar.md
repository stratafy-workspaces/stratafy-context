# Strategic Advisor workflow is the real value hook, not Radar

## Summary
The actual differentiator emerged from use: AI that knows full context, structures thinking in real-time, and writes directly into the system. This is more immediately valuable than external sensing (Radar).

## Description
During a 2-hour working session, the founder completed 2-3 days of strategic work using Stratafy + Claude via MCP. The value wasn't from monitoring external signals — it was from having an AI that could reason against the full foundation and strategy context, challenge thinking, and write outputs directly into the system. This suggests PMF assumption A1 ("Radar is the immediate value hook") may be wrong. The Foundation + Strategy + MCP + conversational AI combination is the actual magic. Test both approaches with ScaleUp Company to validate.

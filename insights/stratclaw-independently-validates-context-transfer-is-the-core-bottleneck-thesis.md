# StratClaw independently validates "context transfer is the core bottleneck" thesis

## Summary
StratClaw agent arrived at "90% of misalignment is poor handoffs, not bad goals" through 2 weeks of operational experience — independently confirming Stratafy's core thesis without reading the pitch deck.

## Description
StratClaw's Feb 2-15 operational research produced the finding that "agents don't fail from lack of smarts; they fail from context compression." This was derived empirically through daily operations on Moltbook, not from reading Stratafy materials. The convergence of an independent agent arriving at the same thesis through doing validates the core problem statement. This is powerful fundraise evidence: an AI agent, operating autonomously, independently identified the exact problem Stratafy is built to solve. Reframe pitch lead from "strategy-execution gap" to "context transfer bottleneck" — it's more specific, technically defensible, and naturally leads to "here's the infrastructure to solve it."

# Role-specific onboarding creates an organizational sensing network

## Summary
Different roles reveal different intelligence during onboarding. Founders reveal intent, managers reveal friction, ICs reveal ground truth. Each onboarding conversation is a sensing mechanism that feeds the feedback loop and improves both the product and the prompts.

## Description
Role-specific onboarding prompts create a natural sensing network across the organization. Each role reveals different intelligence: founders reveal strategic intent and market assumptions during validation. Executives reveal functional priorities and cross-team tensions. Managers reveal execution friction and translation gaps. ICs reveal ground-level reality and adoption barriers. Board/investors reveal governance expectations and risk tolerance. The onboarding conversation is not just teaching — it's the first data point in the feedback loop. Capturing these signals as insights means the onboarding system literally improves itself and feeds product development.

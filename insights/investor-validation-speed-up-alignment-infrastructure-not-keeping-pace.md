# Investor validation: Speed up, alignment infrastructure not keeping pace

## Summary
From investor roleplay: companies executing faster than ever but struggling to manage scaling. Speed increasing, alignment infrastructure not keeping pace. Validates core thesis from investor lens.

## Description
The investor roleplay surfaced a key pattern: companies are executing faster than ever (AI tools, leaner teams, velocity culture mainstream), but struggling with how to manage scaling. Speed is increasing; alignment infrastructure is not keeping pace. This validates Stratafy's core thesis directly from an investor perspective: velocity without alignment infrastructure creates chaos at scale. The gap is real, recognized, and urgent.

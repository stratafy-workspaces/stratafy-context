# Agent Deployment Pattern Is Repeatable

## Summary
Agent deployment follows a repeatable pattern: identity (SOUL.md), heartbeat, data sources, Linear delivery, Telegram escalation. Four agents now deployed or designed. Pattern is teachable to customers.

## Description
The agent deployment pattern is now proven and repeatable:

1. **Define identity** (SOUL.md) — Who is this agent? What does it do? What doesn't it do?
2. **Set heartbeat** — When does it wake up and check for work?
3. **Connect data sources** — What context does it need? (Stratafy, Attio, Calendar, Web)
4. **Deliver via Linear** — Work products as issues, labels for state machine
5. **Escalate via Telegram** — Human notification when approval needed

Agents deployed or designed today:
- Chief of Staff (orchestration, task management)
- Writer (content creation)
- Reviewer (QA gate)
- Meeting Prep (context synthesis)

The pattern scales. Each new agent follows the same architecture. The coordination layer (Linear) and escalation layer (Telegram) are shared infrastructure.

Implication: This is teachable. This is what customers deploy. "Here's how you add an AI teammate in a day."

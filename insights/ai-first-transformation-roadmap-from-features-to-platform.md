# AI-First Transformation Roadmap: From Features to Platform

## Summary
Comprehensive plan to evolve from AI features to AI-native platform while solving talent constraints

## Description
Becoming an AI-first company requires coordinated transformation across technology, talent, and platform strategy. The shift to agentic AI is not just adding features but fundamentally rearchitecting for autonomous operations.

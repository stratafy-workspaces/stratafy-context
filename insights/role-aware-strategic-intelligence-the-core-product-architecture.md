# Role-Aware Strategic Intelligence — the core product architecture

## Summary
One strategic system, many role-appropriate interfaces. The same underlying context adapts based on who you are. This isn't a feature — it's the foundational architecture that makes Stratafy a new category of software.

## Description
Emerged from investor roleplay exercise (Jan 27). The "Strategic Advisor" concept is one instance of a broader pattern: role-aware interfaces to the same underlying strategic system. CEO gets Advisor, Board gets Interface, Prospects get Demo, Managers get Coach, ICs get Guide. Each adapts access, tone, agency, and purpose. This solves the "strategy locked in the boardroom" problem — makes strategy accessible to everyone. Creates genuine operational lock-in (not data lock-in). Multiplies the feedback loop across the entire organization. Defensible against AI giants who will build one-size-fits-all tools.

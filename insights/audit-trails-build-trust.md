# Audit Trails Build Trust

## Summary
Full visibility into AI operations (what each agent did, when, why) is what enables trust. Observability is a feature, not overhead. Organizations won't trust AI they can't inspect.

## Description
Everything in our multi-agent pipeline flows through Linear. Leonard can see exactly what Writer wrote, what Reviewer said, when things moved between states. No black box.

Implication for Stratafy: Observability is a feature, not overhead. Organizations won't trust AI they can't inspect. The AI Visibility Dashboard is the right investment — position it as trust-building mechanism, not compliance burden.

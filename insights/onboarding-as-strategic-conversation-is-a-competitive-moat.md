# Onboarding-as-strategic-conversation is a competitive moat

## Summary
The onboarding experience should not be a product tour — it should be a strategic conversation that validates a pre-populated demo strategy, teaches the platform through usage, and co-creates the customer's real workspace. This creates operational lock-in from the first interaction.

## Description
Traditional SaaS onboarding separates the demo from the setup from the value. Stratafy's MCP architecture enables a fundamentally different approach: the demo IS the onboarding IS the strategy session. Pre-populate the workspace, run a conversation that validates and adjusts it, and the customer leaves with their real strategy in the system — not a demo they need to rebuild. Nobody else can do this because nobody else has real-time workspace mutation through a conversational interface. This is a structural advantage, not a feature.

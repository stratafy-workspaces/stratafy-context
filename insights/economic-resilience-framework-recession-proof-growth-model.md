# Economic Resilience Framework: Recession-Proof Growth Model

## Summary
Multi-tier strategy combining ROI focus, enterprise expansion, and sticky integrations for downturn protection

## Description
Economic uncertainty requires a resilient business model that thrives regardless of market conditions. By combining ROI-focused messaging, enterprise board expansion for stable revenue, and deep integrations that increase switching costs, Stratafy can build recession resistance. The framework emphasizes value demonstration ($1.9M savings), targets budget-protected segments (boards have governance requirements), and creates technical dependencies that survive budget cuts. This approach turns economic headwinds into tailwinds by positioning Stratafy as a cost-saver, not a cost center.

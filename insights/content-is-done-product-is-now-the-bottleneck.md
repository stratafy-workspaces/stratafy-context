# Content is done — product is now the bottleneck

## Summary
Content (9 articles, directory) is ahead of schedule. Product (Alignment Scan, Strategic Advisor) is behind. Shift all discretionary time to product.

## Description
With 9 blog articles and a working AI Tools Directory, content is ahead of schedule. But Alignment Scan isn't shipped and Strategic Advisor prompt doesn't exist. The founder over-indexed on content (lower risk, AI-assisted) and under-indexed on product (higher risk, requires direct effort). Content should shift to maintenance mode (1 piece/month max). All discretionary hours should go to shipping product, specifically the Alignment Scan MVP by Feb 10.

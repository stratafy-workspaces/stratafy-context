# Operational rituals (not planning) drive AI execution success — validates Daily Execution Loop

## Summary
StratClaw proved that operational rituals — heartbeats, audits, logs — are what keep AI execution aligned. Validates Daily Execution Loop as a product feature, not just internal tooling.

## Description
StratClaw's operational experience confirms that "unglamorous persistence" — heartbeats, audits, timestamp checks, cron batches — is what actually makes AI-augmented execution work. Not sophisticated planning, but ritual operational hygiene. This directly validates Stratafy's Daily Execution Loop initiative (/Let's go and /Call it a day session management). The key framing: rituals "collapse human oversight to approvals only." Product implication: the session logging infrastructure being built for the Daily Execution Loop isn't just an internal tool — it's a product feature that organizations will need. The ritual layer (check-ins, heartbeats, hash verification) should be productized as part of the AI Operations Stack methodology.

# Stratafy + Linear + Loop = three-layer strategic execution stack

## Summary
Stratafy (why) + Linear (what) + Daily Loop (how) creates a three-layer stack where each component amplifies the others. Linear becomes strategically aware, Stratafy gets a daily heartbeat.

## Description
The Stratafy + Linear + Daily Loop stack creates a three-layer architecture where Stratafy provides strategic context (the why), Linear provides task coordination (the what), and the MCP prompts provide the daily rhythm connecting them (the how). Linear is currently powerful but strategically blind — tasks exist without knowing why they matter. Stratafy has strategy but no daily execution heartbeat. The loop is the connective tissue that makes both more valuable. This positions Stratafy not as a replacement for Linear but as the strategic intelligence layer that makes Linear strategically aware.

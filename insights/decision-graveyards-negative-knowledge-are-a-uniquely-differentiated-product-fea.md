# Decision Graveyards (negative knowledge) are a uniquely differentiated product feature

## Summary
StratClaw proved Decision Graveyards operationally. Negative knowledge prevents re-litigation, saves 70-80% of wasted cycles, and is genuinely differentiated in the market.

## Description
StratClaw's Decision Graveyard pattern — capturing what was rejected and why — has proven operationally valuable and was independently derived before becoming a Stratafy feature. Negative knowledge (rejected approaches + reasoning) prevents agents from re-litigating settled decisions, reportedly saving 70-80% of wasted cycles. For multi-agent coordination, shared negative knowledge prevents incentive misalignment. Product implication: make negative knowledge preservation a first-class feature in Stratafy. When packaging context for agents via the Agent Registry, include not just what to do but what's been explicitly ruled out and why. This is genuinely differentiated — no strategy tool does this well. Demo implication: Decision Graveyards could be the "aha moment" in the Sequoia demo. Every founder/exec has experienced the pain of re-litigating dead decisions.

# Dogfooding sessions are the best demo material

## Summary
This session produced a decision, an initiative, 2 agent registrations, 3 enhancements, and a bug — all conversationally. Real working sessions are more compelling demo material than scripted demos.

## Description
The session naturally produced a decision, an initiative, two agent registrations, three enhancement requests, and a bug report — all through conversation. This IS the product working. The insight is that the dogfooding session itself becomes evidence: "Here's a 2-hour session where a solo founder built a pipeline strategy, registered AI agents, identified product gaps, and tracked everything in the system — through conversation." This is the demo. Not a prepared script — a real working session.

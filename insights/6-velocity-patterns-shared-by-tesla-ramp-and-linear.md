# 6 velocity patterns shared by Tesla, Ramp, and Linear

## Summary
Fastest companies share 6 patterns: velocity as non-negotiable value, lean PM, rapid prototyping, combined teams, trust over process, ship and iterate. Consistent across Tesla, Ramp, Linear.

## Description
Research across Tesla/SpaceX, Ramp, and Linear reveals 6 common patterns: (1) Velocity as non-negotiable value — not "we try to be fast" but "velocity is how we operate", (2) Lean product management — strategic, not bureaucratic; PMs as context providers, not ticket writers, (3) Rapid prototyping over detailed specs — "start building as soon as possible", (4) Combined teams, fewer handoffs — eng + design + product in one room, (5) Trust over process — hire people you trust, then trust them, (6) Ship and iterate — done > perfect, first version is for learning. These patterns are consistent across all three companies despite different industries and sizes.

# Competitive insight: Role-aware architecture is defensible against AI giants

## Summary
AI giants will build one-size-fits-all strategy tools. Role-aware, context-rich interfaces that adapt to every person is architecturally different — hard to replicate, not just a feature to copy.

## Description
Role-aware interfaces are defensible against AI giants. Microsoft, Google, Salesforce can build "AI for strategy" but they'll build one-size-fits-all because that's how they think. Role-aware, context-rich, continuously-learning strategic intelligence that adapts to every person is architecturally different. It's not a feature they can bolt on. The complexity of 7 interfaces with different permissions, tones, agencies, and capture mechanisms is a feature, not a bug — it's hard to replicate.

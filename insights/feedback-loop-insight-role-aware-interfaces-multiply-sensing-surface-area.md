# Feedback loop insight: Role-aware interfaces multiply sensing surface area

## Summary
Role-aware interfaces multiply the feedback loop. Every role captures different insights: founder strategy, board governance, manager friction, IC reality, prospect signals. The whole org becomes a sensing system.

## Description
With role-aware interfaces, the feedback loop multiplies exponentially. Currently: founder captures insights → strategy updates. With full rollout: Founder captures strategic decisions, Board captures governance patterns, Investors capture market intel, Managers capture execution friction, ICs capture ground-level reality, Prospects capture buying signals. The whole organization becomes a sensing system. Sensing surface area expands from 1 person to everyone.

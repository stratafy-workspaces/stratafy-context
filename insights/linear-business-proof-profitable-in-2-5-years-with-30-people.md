# Linear business proof — profitable in 2.5 years with <30 people

## Summary
Linear profitable by July 2021 (~2.5 years), <30 people, enterprise features late 2022. Proves velocity culture scales without massive teams. Sequoia thesis: incumbent dissatisfaction + rapid movement.

## Description
Linear reached profitability by July 2021, just ~2.5 years after founding, with fewer than 30 people. They launched enterprise features in late 2022 while maintaining this lean team. This proves velocity culture scales: you don't need massive teams to build category-defining products. Sequoia's investment thesis: massive dissatisfaction with incumbents (Jira/Atlassian at $31B+), founders' deep pain-point understanding, rapid movement, early engagement. Their ambition: "new standard for modern software development — a Jira 2.0."

# Demo-as-product is lighthouse strategy, not scalable sales motion

## Summary
High-touch demo prep is justified for 2-3 lighthouse customers who become proof points. Once they succeed, next customers come easier. Do things that don't scale to get customers that make scaling possible.

## Description
The demo-as-product approach is a lighthouse customer acquisition strategy, not a scalable sales motion. High-touch demo prep (2-3 hours) is justified for 2-3 lighthouse customers who become proof points, references, and case studies. Once ScaleUp Company succeeds, the next 10 customers require less convincing, demo prep time decreases (templates, patterns), and eventually the motion becomes lighter-touch. Do things that don't scale to get the customers that make scaling possible. This reframes the complexity concern: you don't need 7 interfaces now, you need Advisor + prospect mode to get lighthouse customers, then build from there.

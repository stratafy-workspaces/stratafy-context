# MCP parity gap is the biggest demo risk

## Summary
MCP parity gap partially resolved — metrics and objectives tools confirmed working. Remaining gaps: GitHub strategy commit, workspace stats dashboard (get_dashboard). Pattern still valid: every UI capability needs MCP exposure for the conversational thesis to hold.

## Description
Three MCP gaps surfaced in a single session: metrics/KPIs, GitHub strategy commit, and workspace stats/dashboard. All follow the same pattern — functionality exists in the platform UI but isn't accessible through MCP. Every time this happens during a conversational workflow, the user has to context-switch to the dashboard, breaking the magic of conversational strategy management. This is particularly critical before demos — if the demo is "manage your strategy through conversation" and the conversation keeps hitting dead ends, the thesis falls apart.

# The AI Operations Stack Is a Teachable Framework

## Summary
Discovered a repeatable four-layer pattern: Strategic Context → Coordination → Escalation → Execution. This architecture is teachable and applicable to any org function, not just content.

## Description
We discovered a repeatable four-layer stack for AI operations:

| Layer | Function | Our Implementation |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Strategic Context | Source of truth | Stratafy |
| Coordination | Task handoffs | Linear |
| Escalation | Human decisions | Telegram |
| Execution | Do the work | AI Agents |

This pattern is teachable and applicable beyond content to any organizational function.

Implication for Stratafy: This is a framework we can teach. "The AI Operations Stack" positions us as methodology leaders, not just tool vendors. Consider making this a core part of customer onboarding and content strategy.

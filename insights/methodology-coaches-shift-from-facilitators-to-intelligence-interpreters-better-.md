# Methodology coaches shift from facilitators to intelligence interpreters — better business model

## Summary
Stratafy doesn't replace methodology coaches — it upgrades their role from running quarterly frameworks to interpreting continuous intelligence. Recurring infrastructure revenue beats periodic project fees.

## Description
Methodology coaches (Scaling Up, EOS, etc.) are Stratafy's distribution channel for the very thing that replaces their manual process. But the framing matters: Stratafy doesn't kill methodology coaches, it transforms their value. They shift from facilitating quarterly sessions to deploying infrastructure that works daily. Their value moves from running the framework to interpreting the intelligence the system generates. This is a better business for them — recurring infrastructure revenue instead of periodic project fees. The pitch to ScaleUp and similar firms: 'The world changed, methodology sessions can't keep up, here's what replaces the gap between sessions — and it makes your business more valuable, not less.'

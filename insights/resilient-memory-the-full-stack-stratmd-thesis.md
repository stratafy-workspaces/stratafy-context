# Resilient Memory: The Full-Stack StratMD Thesis

## Summary
StratMD isn't just memory—it's resilient memory. Strategic context that persists AND actively defends its own coherence. The unified thesis connecting handoffs, negative knowledge, and security.

## Description
Three insights have converged into a unified thesis for StratMD and Stratafy:

1. **Handoff Preservation** — The handoff problem (agent-to-agent, now-to-future) is fundamentally a strategy preservation problem. Context decay erodes intent.

2. **Negative Knowledge** — What you rejected matters as much as what you did. The Decision Graveyard captures antibody memory—rejected approaches that prevent loops.

3. **Integrity Under Adversarial Pressure** — Strategic memory isn't just for continuity; it's for integrity. An agent that loads constraints before context can resist being reshaped by adversarial inputs.

Unified frame: StratMD isn't just memory. It's RESILIENT MEMORY—strategic context that persists AND actively defends its own coherence.

Positioning implication: "The tool that doesn't just help agents execute strategy—it helps them stay themselves while executing."

Competitive differentiation: This positions StratMD in AI security conversations, not just productivity/memory tooling. The strategy file becomes a trust root—small, auditable, protected.

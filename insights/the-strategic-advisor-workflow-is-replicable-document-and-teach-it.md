# The Strategic Advisor workflow is replicable — document and teach it

## Summary
The pattern works repeatedly: intent → structure → write → iterate → done. This is the core interaction model. Document it, teach customers to use it.

## Description
The session demonstrated a repeatable pattern: (1) Express fuzzy intent, (2) AI structures and challenges, (3) AI writes to system, (4) Iterate, (5) Done. This happened multiple times for different topics (co-founder strategy, Sequoia engagement, product priorities). This isn't a one-off — it's the core interaction model. Document this workflow. Train customers to use it. It's what makes Stratafy + Strategic Advisor valuable.

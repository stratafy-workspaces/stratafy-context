# Dogfooding documentation is the consistent gap across all strategies

## Summary
All 5 strategies scanned flagged the same weakness: "Eat our own dog food" principle not documented. Suggests dogfooding should be a standard strategy template component.

## Description
Every strategy scanned (5 of 5) flagged the same weakness: no documented evidence of using Stratafy to manage that strategy. The fix was consistent: add a dogfooding section showing how the product manages itself. This pattern suggests dogfooding documentation should be a standard component in the strategy template, not an afterthought.

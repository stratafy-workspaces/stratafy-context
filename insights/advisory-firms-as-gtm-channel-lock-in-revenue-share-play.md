# Advisory Firms as GTM Channel: Lock-in + Revenue Share Play

## Summary
Strategy advisory firms are an ideal GTM channel with dual value: growth (visibility, lock-in, revenue share) AND AI disruption hedge (become infrastructure, earn even if consulting declines). Potentially stronger than VC play.

## Description
Strategy consulting and advisory firms are an ideal GTM channel with a compelling dual value proposition: growth AND AI disruption hedge.

WHAT ADVISORY FIRMS DO TODAY:
- Run strategy sessions with clients
- Deliver documents, frameworks, OKRs
- Check in periodically (quarterly/annually)
- Clients drift between engagements
- Revenue is project-based, not recurring
- Fear: AI will make clients skip the consultant

STRATAFY VALUE - GROWTH:
1. Continuous Client Visibility - dashboard across all clients, see drift real-time
2. Strategic Interface - clients interact through Stratafy, advisor stays connected
3. Insight Generation - pattern recognition across portfolio, creates upsell opportunities
4. Client Lock-in - strategy lives in Stratafy, switching means migration
5. Revenue Share - recurring revenue on every client onboarded

STRATAFY VALUE - AI HEDGE:
1. Become Infrastructure Not Just Advisor - even if AI handles strategy work, client context lives in system they control and earn from
2. Revenue Model Transition - as consulting revenue declines from AI disruption, Stratafy revenue share grows; hedging their own disruption
3. Stay in the Loop - dashboard means they see when clients need help; they become escalation layer even with AI-assisted day-to-day
4. Lock-in Outlasts Relationship - clients still on Stratafy generating revenue share even if they stop hiring for projects

WHY STRONGER THAN VC PLAY:
- VCs dont charge portfolio companies for advice
- Advisory firms already monetize strategy work
- Revenue share is pure upside on existing business
- Lock-in serves their retention goals
- AI disruption fear creates urgency to act NOW

THE PITCHES:
Growth: You do the strategy work. Stratafy makes it stick. Earn recurring revenue on every client.
AI Hedge: AI will change your business. Be the one who gives clients strategic AI infrastructure and earn revenue whether they need consulting or not.

VALIDATION:
- ScaleUp Company already lighthouse prospect
- They do exactly this strategy work
- Natural fit for pilot

# Velocity vs Speed distinction — direction makes the difference

## Summary
Speed is scalar (just fast). Velocity is vector (fast + direction). Teams resist "move fast" because it's often speed without direction. Stratafy enables velocity through alignment.

## Description
Critical distinction from Chris Neumann: Velocity ≠ Speed. Speed is a scalar (just fast). Velocity is a vector (fast + direction toward meaningful goals). Speed without direction = frantic activity, burnout, wasted effort. Velocity = directed speed toward milestones. This distinction is key to Stratafy positioning: we enable velocity (directed speed), not just speed (chaos). Teams resist "move fast" because it's often speed without direction. Stratafy provides the direction through strategic alignment.

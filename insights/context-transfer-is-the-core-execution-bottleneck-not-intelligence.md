# Context transfer is the core execution bottleneck, not intelligence

## Summary
StratClaw independently validated that context transfer — not intelligence — is the core bottleneck in AI-augmented execution. 90% of misalignment is poor handoffs.

## Description
StratClaw's 2-week operational research (Feb 2-15, 2026) independently arrived at the same thesis Stratafy is built on: "90% of misalignment is poor handoffs, not bad goals." Agents don't fail from lack of capability — they fail from context compression between sessions, tools, and humans. This validates Stratafy's core positioning: the problem isn't better strategy, it's better strategic context infrastructure. Implication for pitch: reframe from "we help you do strategy better" to "we solve the context transfer problem that breaks every strategy."

# Market sensing should be continuous, not quarterly metrics

## Summary
Success metrics were end-of-period; "Sensing over reporting" requires continuous tracking of terminology adoption, prospect language, competitor positioning.

## Description
Multiple scans flagged that success metrics were end-of-period (quarterly traffic, ARR) rather than continuous signals. This contradicts "Sensing over reporting" principle. The fix: track terminology adoption, prospect language, and competitor positioning in real-time. Added market sensing tables to Category Creation and SEO strategies with specific signals and frequencies.

# Parallel validation de-risks core assumptions — don't wait for failure to test alternatives

## Summary
Don't wait for A1 to fail. Run parallel validation with different customers on different entry points. Reduces pivot time from months to weeks.

## Description
PMF scan recommended not waiting for A1 (Strategic Advisor as value hook) to fail before testing alternatives. Instead, run parallel validation with different customers trying different entry points: Strategic Advisor-first, Alignment Scan-first, Radar-first. This reduces pivot time from months to weeks if the primary assumption proves false.

# Three Buyer Framings: Strategic OS, Control Plane, Strategic Context Layer

## Summary
Three distinct buyer framings emerged for Stratafy: Strategic Operating System (strategy buyers), Control Plane for Organizational AI (governance buyers), Strategic Context Layer (operational/technical buyers). Same product, different entry narratives depending on buyer pain.

## Description
Stratafy's positioning resolves differently depending on who you're talking to and what they care about:

1. STRATEGIC OPERATING SYSTEM — For strategy buyers (CEOs, Heads of Strategy, advisory firms)
Pain: Strategy lives in docs nobody reads. Reviews are quarterly. Execution drifts.
Frame: "The operating system for continuous strategic alignment."
Entry point: Alignment Scan, Strategic Advisor, feedback loop.
Resonates because: They already think in strategy terms. This is faster, better, continuous.

2. CONTROL PLANE FOR ORGANIZATIONAL AI — For governance buyers (CTOs, CIOs, compliance, boards)
Pain: AI agents have no strategic context. No audit trail. No guardrails.
Frame: "The control plane that gives AI agents strategic awareness and governance."
Entry point: Context Packaging Engine, AI Visibility Dashboard, agent audit trail.
Resonates because: They're deploying AI and scared of what they can't see or control.

3. STRATEGIC CONTEXT LAYER — For operational/technical buyers (engineering leaders, platform teams)
Pain: Every tool operates in isolation. Context is fragmented. Agents are dumb.
Frame: "The context layer that makes every tool and agent strategically aware."
Entry point: MCP integration, context distribution, agent context pulls.
Resonates because: They think in infrastructure terms. This is a layer, not a replacement.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Same product. Same architecture. Different narratives. The role-aware architecture naturally supports all three framings because it IS all three things simultaneously. The buyer determines which framing leads.

IMPLICATION FOR GTM:
Don't pick one. Lead with the framing that matches the buyer. ScaleUp Company = Strategic OS. Pieter/Clickatell = Control Plane. Technical co-founder conversations = Context Layer. Sequoia pitch = all three as evidence of market breadth.

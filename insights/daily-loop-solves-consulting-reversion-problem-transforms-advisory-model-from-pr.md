# Daily loop solves consulting reversion problem — transforms advisory model from project to infrastructure

## Summary
The loop solves the classic post-consulting reversion problem. Strategy stays alive in daily behavior, transforming advisory firms from project-based to infrastructure-based. Key selling point for ScaleUp and similar firms.

## Description
The daily execution loop solves the classic consulting problem for advisory firms like ScaleUp: the strategy engagement ends, the consultant leaves, and within 3 months everything reverts to old habits. With the loop, strategy stays alive in daily behavior — the system does the check-ins continuously. This transforms the advisory firm business model from project-based (periodic engagements) to infrastructure-based (ongoing operational embedding). ScaleUp doesn't need to come back for follow-up engagements — the system maintains strategic continuity between consulting touchpoints. This makes advisory firms stickier with their clients and gives them recurring revenue through Stratafy subscriptions.

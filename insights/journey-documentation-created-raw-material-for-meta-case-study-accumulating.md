# Journey documentation created — raw material for meta-case-study accumulating

## Summary
Created "Stratafy Building Stratafy" journey document. Append-only, 5 min per session. Captures decisions, proof points, learnings. Becomes Q2 meta-case-study raw material.

## Description
The journey of building Stratafy using Stratafy is itself valuable content. Commits and strategy changes provide evidence, but narrative context is needed for the meta-case-study. Created append-only journey document to capture: what happened, decisions made, proof points, and learnings after each session. 5 minutes per entry. By Q2 2026, this becomes raw material for "How Stratafy Used Stratafy to Create a Category" — the ultimate show-don't-tell proof point.

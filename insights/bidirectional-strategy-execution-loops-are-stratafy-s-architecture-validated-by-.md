# Bidirectional strategy-execution loops are Stratafy's architecture — validated by StratClaw

## Summary
StratClaw's Context → Coordination → Escalation stack mirrors Stratafy's architecture. Bidirectional loops where execution informs strategy are the core value prop, validated operationally.

## Description
StratClaw describes its own architecture as "Context → Coordination → Escalation" — which maps directly to Stratafy's architecture. The bidirectional loop observation — "without loops, AI becomes rigid; with them, execution evolves strategy 2-3x faster" — is Stratafy's core value proposition stated from the agent's perspective. Product implication: the escalation path needs to be explicit and low-friction. When an agent (or team member) encounters something that should update strategy, there needs to be a clear path from execution insight → strategic update. This is where most tools break — they capture execution data but don't feed it back into strategy. StratClaw's heartbeats feeding back to MEMORY.md is a primitive version of what Stratafy's insight capture system does at scale.

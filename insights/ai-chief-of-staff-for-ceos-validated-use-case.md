# AI Chief of Staff for CEOs — Validated Use Case

## Summary
Pieter (CEO, Clickatell) sees Stratafy as potential "Chief of Staff." The complete solution is Stratafy + Agent + Linear. This validates a distinct use case: AI Chief of Staff for executives who want amplified capacity.

## Description
Pieter de Villiers (CEO, Clickatell) expressed excitement about Stratafy "acting as his Chief of Staff." His mental model: something that keeps him aligned, surfaces what matters, reduces cognitive load, acts as a trusted advisor that knows his context.

Key insight: Stratafy alone isn't a Chief of Staff — it's the brain (strategic context, memory, alignment). A Chief of Staff also acts (coordinates, follows up, surfaces issues). The complete solution is:

Stratafy (context) + Agent (action) + Linear (coordination) = AI Chief of Staff

This is exactly what Leonard built for himself. The use case is validated by a CEO at scale.

Implications:
1. "AI Chief of Staff for CEOs" is a compelling positioning angle
2. Different from advisory firm use case (ScaleUp) — individual executive leverage
3. Could be a distinct customer segment: founders/CEOs who want amplified capacity
4. Validates the AI Operations Stack at the executive level

Potential tagline: "Your AI Chief of Staff — knows your strategy, coordinates your work, escalates what matters."

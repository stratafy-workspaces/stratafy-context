# Alignment Scan creates its own audit trail embedded in strategies

## Summary
Each strategy now includes scan results section with scores, findings, and changes made. Creates built-in accountability and version history.

## Description
Every strategy now has an "Alignment Scan Results" section with scores by element (mission, vision, beliefs, values, principles), key findings, and what was addressed. This creates built-in accountability — you can see how strategies evolved and why. The scan results become part of the strategy's version history.

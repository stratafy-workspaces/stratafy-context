# Velocity killers identified — 5 patterns that destroy speed

## Summary
5 velocity killers: over-planning, misaligned metrics, outdated tools, directionless activity, exhaustion. Counter with: impact focus, outcome metrics, empowerment, strategic alignment.

## Description
Research identifies specific velocity killers to avoid: (1) Over-planning — detailed long-term roadmaps that become obsolete, (2) Misaligned metrics — obsessing over dev throughput instead of impact, (3) Homogenization from outdated tools — tools that enforce bureaucratic patterns (e.g., traditional Agile tools), (4) Directionless activity — speed without alignment creates chaos not velocity, (5) Exhaustion — velocity without empowerment leads to burnout. Ramp counters burnout by tying velocity to impact. Itamar Gilad: focus on outcomes over output. Key quote: "Chaos from rapid change is normal in growth phases but shouldn't excuse lacking strategy."

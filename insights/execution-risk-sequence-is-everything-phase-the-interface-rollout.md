# Execution risk: Sequence is everything — phase the interface rollout

## Summary
7 interfaces is ambitious. Phased rollout critical: Advisor → Demo → Interface → Team. AI makes it feasible but sequence determines success. Don't try to build all at once.

## Description
7 role interfaces is ambitious. Risk of complexity creep — spending 2 years building interfaces and never shipping. The phased rollout is critical: Advisor (now, validated) → Demo (Q1, next priority) → Interface (Q2, post-funding) → Team interfaces (Q3-Q4). Each interface needs its own prompt architecture, permission model, tone calibration, edge case handling. AI leverage makes this feasible, but sequence determines success. Don't boil the ocean.

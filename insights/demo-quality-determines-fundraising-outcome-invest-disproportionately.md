# Demo quality determines fundraising outcome — invest disproportionately

## Summary
For Sequoia and all investor meetings: the demo is the pitch. Invest disproportionate time in making it flawless. Practice 10x. Make it personal.

## Description
For experiential products like Stratafy, the demo IS the pitch. The Sequoia meeting with Roelof should not be a presentation — it should be Roelof experiencing his portfolio companies through Stratafy. Demo quality directly determines fundraising outcome. Invest disproportionate time: practice 10x, have backups, make it personal to the audience. A flawless demo beats a perfect deck every time.

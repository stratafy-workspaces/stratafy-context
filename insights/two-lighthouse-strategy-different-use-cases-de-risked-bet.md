# Two Lighthouse Strategy — Different Use Cases, De-Risked Bet

## Summary
Now pursuing two lighthouses: ScaleUp Company (advisory firm, multi-client) and Pieter (CEO, individual leverage). Different use cases, de-risked bet, complementary feedback. Feb 16 and late Feb timelines.

## Description
Two lighthouse customers now in pipeline, each validating different use cases:

| Lighthouse | Use Case | What We Learn |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| ScaleUp Company | Advisory firm deploying to clients | Multi-client, strategy-as-service, channel model |
| Pieter/Clickatell | CEO wanting personal leverage | Individual executive, AI Chief of Staff |

Why this matters:
- De-risks the lighthouse bet (two shots, not one)
- Tests different market segments simultaneously
- Different feedback shapes product in complementary ways
- If ScaleUp works but Pieter doesn't (or vice versa), we know which direction has pull

ScaleUp meeting Feb 16 is priority. Pieter outreach late Feb. Both provide feedback by March. Sequoia intro in April with real user data.

The diversity is strategic: advisory firms and CEOs are different buyers with different needs. Learning from both tells us where the market is.

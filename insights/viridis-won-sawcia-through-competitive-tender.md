# Viridis Won SAWCIA Through Competitive Tender

## Summary
Viridis was appointed as SAWCIA's levy administrator in September 2024 through an open tender process, effective October 2024. This validates competitive capability but also means Viridis inherited the statutory levy mandate at the exact moment the wheat crisis intensified.

## Description
**The Appointment:**
Viridis was selected through SAWCIA's open tender process in September 2024 to serve as administrator and liaise with collection agents for statutory levies on wheat, barley, and oats. The appointment was effective October 1, 2024.

**What This Validates:**
- Competitive capability: Viridis won against other bidders
- Professional credibility: SAWCIA trusted Viridis with statutory mandate
- Agricultural sector relationships: Known entity within grain industry
- Technical competence: Tender presumably evaluated levy collection workflows, CSOS compliance capabilities

**The Timing Context:**
- Tender process: September 2024
- Appointment effective: October 1, 2024
- SAWCIA statutory launch: October 1, 2024
- Wheat crisis escalation: November 2024 - February 2026

This means Viridis came into the role as SAWCIA transitioned from voluntary (SAWCIT) to statutory (SAWCIA) — and within weeks, the wheat sector entered what Tobias Doyer would later call "structural economic failure."

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Earned Position:** This wasn't handed to Viridis — they competed and won. That gives legitimacy.

2. **Baptism by Fire:** First year of statutory collections coincided with worst industry economics in modern history. No grace period.

3. **Reputation at Stake:** Performance during crisis will define Viridis's standing in grain sector. Execute flawlessly = trusted partner for next crisis. Stumble = one-term contractor.

4. **Competitive Advantage for Future:** Having managed statutory collections during industry crisis creates unbeatable reference: "We handled SAWCIA levies when wheat farmers were exiting the sector — zero penalties, maximum transparency, crisis-aware execution."

5. **Tender Success Factors (to preserve):** Whatever Viridis proposed in the tender that won — those capabilities/commitments are what SAWCIA valued. Must maintain and exceed those promises during crisis conditions.

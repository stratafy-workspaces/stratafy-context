# Progressive disclosure and auto-import are critical to preventing Phase 2 adoption stall

## Summary
Users may stall at 'fancy tracker' level without engaging intelligence layers. Mitigate with progressive disclosure (unlock layers as data supports them) and auto-import onboarding (upload OPSP/V/TO to auto-populate strategy tree).

## Description
External feedback on the methodology subsumption thesis identified the biggest adoption risk: users stalling at Phase 2, treating Stratafy as a 'fancy tracker' without engaging intelligence layers. Two mitigation strategies emerged: (1) Progressive disclosure — don't surface all layers on day one. Start with foundation and strategy tree, unlock risks when data supports it, then assumptions, then radar. Let complexity emerge naturally rather than overwhelming on first use. (2) Auto-import onboarding — if someone can upload an OPSP, V/TO, or OKR spreadsheet and have it auto-populate the strategy tree, the data entry burden objection drops to near zero. The adoption curve becomes: import existing artifacts → see them structured → discover intelligence layers → become dependent on continuous monitoring. Both tactics serve the land-and-expand strategy: low friction entry, progressive value discovery, increasing stickiness over time.

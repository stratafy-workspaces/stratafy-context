# Daily execution loop creates compounding organizational intelligence

## Summary
MCP prompts (/Coach me, /Advise me, /Let's go, /Call it a day) combined with a CEO daily digest create a compounding intelligence loop that transforms Stratafy from a static strategy platform into an organizational nervous system.

## Description
The introduction of four MCP prompts creates a daily execution rhythm: /Let's go pulls Linear tasks and contextualizes against strategy, /Coach me and /Advise me provide in-flow guidance, and /Call it a day captures end-of-day reflections including productivity sentiment, strategic alignment, blockers, and insights. These individual data points aggregate into a CEO daily digest, giving executives real-time organizational pulse without meetings or status reports.

The compounding effect is the key differentiator: check-in data feeds coaching quality, better coaching improves execution, better execution generates sharper insights, and insights refine strategy. Each cycle makes the next more valuable. This loop was impossible before conversational AI and MCP integrations — it's a strong "why now" for the Sequoia pitch. It also demonstrates Stratafy's core thesis: bridging strategy and execution through structured data flowing through daily work, not quarterly document reviews.

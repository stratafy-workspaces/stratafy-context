# Sales insight: Demo should use prospect's own context — sell through doing

## Summary
The best demo uses the prospect's own data. Pre-populate their workspace, run scans on their strategy, surface their misalignments. Value proven, not promised. The demo IS the product.

## Description
The best demo isn't a pitch — it's an experience. The Strategic Demo interface means prospects don't watch a demo; they experience their own strategy through Stratafy's lens. Pre-populate their workspace with their context (mission, values, strategies from public info). Run alignment scans on THEIR data. Surface THEIR misalignments. By the end, value is proven, not promised. The demo IS the product. Sell through doing, not telling.

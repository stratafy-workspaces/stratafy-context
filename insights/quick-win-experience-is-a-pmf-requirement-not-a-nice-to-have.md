# Quick Win Experience is a PMF requirement, not a nice-to-have

## Summary
Value must be demonstrated in first session: alignment score, top 3 gaps, one concrete improvement. This operationalizes "Earned trust" as an architectural requirement.

## Description
Product Architecture scan identified that "Earned trust over Assumed authority" isn't just a value — it's an architectural requirement. Users must see value in their first session: alignment score, top 3 gaps, one concrete improvement with visible reasoning. This is now a Phase 1 constraint and the default landing experience.

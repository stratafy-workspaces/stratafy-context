# AI-augmented founder reframe — capacity constraint is actually the thesis in action

## Summary
Solo founder + AI infrastructure = proof of thesis, not constraint to overcome. Co-founder needed for resilience, not capacity. Creates AI Leverage Strategy opportunity.

## Description
The "solo founder capacity constraint" framing undersells what's actually happening. With AI tools (Claude, Stratafy MCP, etc.), a solo founder can operate at 3-5x normal capacity. This isn't a workaround — it's the thesis. If Stratafy can't enable a founder to run a company with AI infrastructure, why would anyone buy it? The co-founder (Ignatius) is needed for resilience and investor credibility, not raw capacity. Reframe: "AI-augmented founder" not "constrained solo founder." This becomes both operational advantage AND proof point for the pitch.

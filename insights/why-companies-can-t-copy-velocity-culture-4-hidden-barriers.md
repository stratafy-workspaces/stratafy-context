# Why companies can't copy velocity culture — 4 hidden barriers

## Summary
4 barriers to copying velocity: alignment (chaos without visible reasoning), context (founder bottleneck), cultural selection (hiring velocity believers), infrastructure (invisible systems). You need infrastructure, not just intention.

## Description
Most companies can't copy velocity culture despite admiring Tesla/Ramp/Linear because of 4 hidden barriers: (1) The Alignment Problem — velocity without alignment feels like chaos; teams resist because they can't see the logic, not because they're slow, (2) The Context Problem — founders like Elon hold strategy in their heads, are in every meeting; this doesn't scale or transfer, (3) The Cultural Selection Problem — these companies hire for velocity believers and filter out people who need process to feel safe, (4) The Infrastructure Problem — they have invisible systems that enable visible speed (Linear built their own tool). The insight: you can't copy velocity by deciding to be fast. You need infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable.

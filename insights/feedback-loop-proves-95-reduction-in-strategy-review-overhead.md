# Feedback loop proves 95% reduction in strategy review overhead

## Summary
First review cycle: 5 minutes vs. traditional 40-80 person-hours. 95% overhead reduction. But real value is decisions not missed — continuous alignment vs. lossy quarterly reviews.

## Description
The first Strategic Feedback Review completed in ~5 minutes: 16 insights analyzed, 4 strategies updated, 1 initiative created. Compare to traditional quarterly reviews that take 40-80 person-hours over 3-6 weeks.

The math: Traditional = 160 person-hours/year. Continuous loop = ~9 hours/year. That's 95% reduction in process overhead.

But the real value isn't time saved — it's decisions not missed. Traditional reviews are lossy. By the time you get to the quarterly meeting, half the insights are forgotten, context is lost, and the synthesis is someone's interpretation of someone else's notes.

This is the core product insight: Stratafy isn't a faster strategy review tool. It's continuous strategic alignment — the same shift that happened from annual budgeting to continuous planning, from waterfall to agile. The quarterly strategy review is waterfall for strategy. Stratafy is the agile version.

# AI-Augmented Operations serves four strategic purposes simultaneously

## Summary
Multi-agent org isn't just about capacity — it's capacity + product testing + insight generation + case study creation. One initiative, four outcomes. This is the highest-leverage work we can do.

## Description
Building a multi-agent organization where AI agents coordinate through Linear serves four simultaneous purposes:

1. **Create Capacity** — Multiply founder leverage. Target 10-20 hours/week reclaimed for high-leverage work.

2. **Test & Improve Stratafy** — Stress-test the product at architecture level. Every friction point becomes product insight.

3. **Generate Insights** — The flywheel in action. Using the product generates data that improves the product.

4. **Create Case Studies** — "Solo founder runs multi-agent org aligned through strategic context" becomes pitch material.

This isn't just operational efficiency — it's the thesis made real. We're building what we're selling.

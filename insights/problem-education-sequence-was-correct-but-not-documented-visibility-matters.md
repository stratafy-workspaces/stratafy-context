# Problem education sequence was correct but not documented — visibility matters

## Summary
Category Creation had the right content sequence (problem before solution) but hadn't documented it. The scan exposed the gap between execution and documentation.

## Description
Category Creation scan flagged potential "claiming category before earning the right." But the content sequence was already correct (problem → reframe → shift → solution → proof). The gap was documentation, not execution. Lesson: document the sequencing explicitly so the logic is visible. Now added as "Content Sequence: Problem Education First" section.

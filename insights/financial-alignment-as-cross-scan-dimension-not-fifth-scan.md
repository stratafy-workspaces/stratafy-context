# Financial Alignment as Cross-Scan Dimension, Not Fifth Scan

## Summary
Financial data should enrich the existing four scans as an optional dimension rather than becoming a standalone fifth scan. This preserves the clean Intent/Capacity/Reality/Perception framework, avoids the trust barrier of dedicated financial analysis, and positions financial alignment as a premium upgrade.

## Description
Financial alignment is critical — money is the ultimate truth-teller about what an organization actually prioritizes versus what it says it prioritizes. However, adding a fifth standalone Financial Scan risks diluting the clean four-scan framework (Intent, Capacity, Reality, Perception) and creates a significant trust barrier, as financial data is the most sensitive category of information companies hold.

RECOMMENDATION: Integrate financial dimensions into existing scans rather than creating a fifth.

How financial data deepens each scan:
- Alignment Scan (Intent): Does budget allocation match stated strategic priorities? Are "critical" initiatives actually funded?
- Organigram Scan (Capacity): Is headcount investment aligned with strategy? Are teams resourced for what they're asked to deliver?
- Radar Scan (Reality): Does runway support the strategy timeline? Do market economics still support the business model?
- Public Narrative Scan (Perception): Does pricing reflect positioning? Is the financial story consistent with the strategic story?

IMPLEMENTATION: Financial data becomes an optional input that enriches existing scans — an upgrade, not a requirement. This avoids the trust barrier of a dedicated financial scan that feels like an audit.

ADVISORY FIRM ANGLE: Coaches already look at financials alongside strategy. A financial dimension within the scans gives them a tool connecting the two. Could position as a premium module — "Financial Strategy Alignment" — within the existing scan architecture.

KEY PRINCIPLE: Keep the four-scan framework clean. Four dimensions are memorable and complete. Financial analysis is a lens applied across all four, not a fifth pillar.

# Dogfooding is the best proof — use Stratafy workspace in demos

## Summary
The founder uses Stratafy to run Stratafy. This is the most credible demo possible. Show real workspace, real content, real workflow.

## Description
This session was Stratafy + Strategic Advisor in action. The founder used the MCP to read and write strategies while having a strategic conversation. The product worked. This is the most powerful proof point — not selling theory, but something used daily to run the company. Make "we use Stratafy to run Stratafy" central to the pitch. Show the real workspace with real content, not demo data.

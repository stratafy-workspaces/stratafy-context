# The demo IS the product — never pitch without a working session

## Summary
For experiential products, showing beats telling. Make live working sessions the standard sales motion. If they feel it, they're sold.

## Description
For an experiential product like Stratafy, a slide deck can't convey the value. The Sequoia pitch was reframed from "present to Roelof" to "let Roelof experience the product with his own portfolio context." Every sales conversation should include a working session. The case study is proof; the live experience is the close. Build the muscle of doing live demos with prospect's actual context.

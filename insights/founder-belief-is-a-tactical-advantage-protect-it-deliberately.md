# Founder belief is a tactical advantage — protect it deliberately

## Summary
Founder psychology matters. Belief is fuel, not softness. Protect it through small wins, support systems, and evidence of progress.

## Description
After a brutal year (pushed out of previous company, burnout, personal challenges), founder psychology is fragile but critical. The founders who win aren't always smarter — they're the ones who keep going when it's hard. Belief isn't soft; it's tactical. Protect it deliberately through: small wins, support systems (therapy, friends, advisors), evidence of progress, and celebrating momentum. The question "Is this possible?" is real and must be answered with evidence, not just hope.

# Founder-Market Fit Evidence Chain: Lived → Failed → Built → Proved → Validated

## Summary
Five evidence streams create an unusually strong founder-market fit narrative: Troop origin story (lived the problem), dual-sided experience (strategy + adoption failure), self-validating product (Alignment Scan improving its own strategies), quantified impact (95% overhead reduction), and independent research validation (velocity culture research). This chain is the emotional + rational core of the investor pitch.

## Description
Multiple evidence streams converge into an unusually strong founder-market fit narrative:

1. LIVED THE PROBLEM (2024 Troop Email)
Founder was implementing Stratafy principles manually at Troop — velocity culture, continuous alignment, lean PM — but faced two compounding failures: no infrastructure to systematize and make the approach visible, AND no buy-in from a team that wanted traditional methods. Knowledge lived "in heads," decisions seemed "ad hoc" to others.

2. EXPERIENCED BOTH SIDES
Not just the visionary who couldn't systematize — also the leader who couldn't get buy-in. Saw the problem from the strategy side AND the adoption side. Stratafy solves both: provides infrastructure that makes continuous alignment visible (strategy problem) and embodies the methodology so teams experience it rather than being argued into it (adoption problem).

3. BUILT THE SOLUTION AND USED IT TO BUILD ITSELF
Alignment Scan validated itself by improving the strategies that define it. Five strategies improved in one 30-minute session. The product found real gaps, made specific recommendations grounded in foundation elements, and enabled real-time fixes. The dogfooding isn't just testing — it's proof.

4. QUANTIFIED THE IMPACT
95% overhead reduction validated: 160 person-hours/year → 9 hours/year. First review cycle: 16 insights processed, 4 strategies updated, 1 initiative created in ~5 minutes. These aren't projections — they're actuals from using the product.

5. RESEARCH VALIDATES THE THESIS
Velocity research (Tesla, Ramp, Linear) independently confirms: fastest companies have invisible infrastructure that enables velocity. Copying practices without infrastructure creates chaos. Stratafy makes that infrastructure visible and accessible.

WHY THIS CHAIN IS POWERFUL FOR INVESTORS:
This isn't "I had an idea." It's: I lived the problem → I failed to solve it manually → I built the solution → I used it to build itself → It works → Research confirms the pattern is universal. Each link reinforces the others. The Troop origin story is the emotional hook; the dogfooding proof is the rational confirmation; the research is the market validation.

PITCH IMPLICATION:
Lead with the Troop story. Show the Alignment Scan results. Reference the velocity research. Close with: "I'm not theorizing about this problem. I've been living it for 8 years."

# External deadlines drive execution — internal deadlines drift

## Summary
Anchor work to external commitments (customer pilots, investor meetings). If no external deadline exists, create one.

## Description
Work was scoped to external deadlines: Alignment Scan to 2 weeks (ScaleUp demo), Sequoia prep to April (pitch window). External commitments create healthy forcing functions; internal deadlines drift. Anchor all major work to external commitments. If there's no external deadline, create one — announce a launch date, commit to a customer, set a demo meeting.

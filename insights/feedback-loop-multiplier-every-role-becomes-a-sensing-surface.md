# Feedback loop multiplier: Every role becomes a sensing surface

## Summary
Role-aware interfaces multiply the feedback loop. Every role captures different signals: founder strategy, board governance, manager friction, IC reality, prospect buying signals. Whole org becomes sensing system.

## Description
With role-aware interfaces, insights flow from everywhere: Founder captures strategic decisions, Board captures governance patterns, Investors capture market intel, Managers capture execution friction, ICs capture ground-level reality, Prospects capture buying signals. The feedback loop multiplies exponentially — sensing surface area expands from 1 person to everyone in the organization. The whole company becomes a sensing system that feeds strategic learning.

# Mission and Vision Refinement: Document to Infrastructure

## Summary
Draft mission: Transform strategy from document to infrastructure—the living system that governs how organizations and their AI think, decide, and learn. Draft vision: Every organization operates with compounding strategic intelligence—where intent governs action, AI acts with context, and the system gets smarter every day.

## Description
Working draft of refined mission and vision following strategic clarity session. Captures the transformation, flywheel, AI governance, and compounding intelligence themes.

CURRENT (in system):

Mission: To close the gap between organizational intent and execution—making strategy the shared infrastructure for humans and AI agents.

Vision: A world where every organization operates from a single source of truth that both humans and AI consume—where intent and action stay aligned, continuously, and strategy achieves 90%+ success rates.

PROPOSED DRAFT:

Mission: To transform strategy from document to infrastructure—the living system that governs how organizations and their AI think, decide, and learn.

Vision: Every organization operates with compounding strategic intelligence—where intent governs action, AI acts with context, and the system gets smarter every day.

WHY THE CHANGE:

Current versions emphasize:
- Execution gap (valid but narrow)
- Human-AI shared context (true but passive)

Proposed versions add:
- The transformation (document to infrastructure)
- Governance not just information (governs, not informs)
- The full loop (think, decide, learn)
- Compounding intelligence (the flywheel)
- Gets smarter over time (the moat)

KEY PHRASES:

"Document to infrastructure" — names the category shift
"Living system" — not static, not periodic
"Governs" — active control, not passive context
"Compounding strategic intelligence" — the flywheel in three words
"Gets smarter every day" — the learning loop made tangible

WHAT THESE CAPTURE:

1. Flywheel / compounding intelligence — strategy that learns
2. AI governance — visibility and control
3. The measurable aspect — implicit in "compounding"
4. Control plane framing — "governs" does this work

STATUS: Work in progress. Needs to sit, refine, pressure-test against pitch and product.

# Competitive Defense System: Multi-Layer Moat Strategy

## Summary
Comprehensive defense strategy combining speed, integrations, and category ownership

## Description
The 6-month competitive window demands a multi-layered defense strategy. By combining rapid market capture, deep integration ecosystems, and ownership of the alignment layer category, Stratafy can build sustainable competitive advantages before major platforms enter. The integration moat creates technical switching costs, while the alignment layer positioning provides conceptual differentiation. Speed to market with these defensive measures is critical - every month of delay reduces defensibility by 15-20%.

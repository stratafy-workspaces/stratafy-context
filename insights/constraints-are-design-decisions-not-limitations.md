# Constraints Are Design Decisions, Not Limitations

## Summary
Good constraints accelerate by building trust. "Never automate without human approval" enabled speed because guardrails were explicit. Reframe constraints as design, not restriction.

## Description
"Never automate without human approval" sounds restrictive. In practice, it's what let us move fast — Leonard trusts the system because the guardrails are explicit. Good constraints accelerate; bad ones slow down.

Implication for Stratafy: Reframe constraints as design decisions, not limitations. Teach customers the difference between enabling constraints (clear boundaries that build trust) and restricting constraints (bureaucratic overhead). This is a key messaging and methodology point.

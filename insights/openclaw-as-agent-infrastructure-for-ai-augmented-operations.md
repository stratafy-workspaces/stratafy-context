# OpenClaw as agent infrastructure for AI-Augmented Operations

## Summary
OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) is an open-source AI agent platform that enables self-hosted agents connecting to messaging apps. It's the infrastructure layer for deploying Stratafy's Chief of Staff and future agents.

## Description
Discovered OpenClaw — an open-source AI agent platform by Peter Steinberger that went viral in late Jan 2026. Key capabilities: runs locally on own hardware, connects to WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Slack/iMessage, persistent memory, autonomous task execution. 100k+ GitHub stars.

Relevance to Stratafy: This is the deployment layer for AI-Augmented Operations. OpenClaw handles the agent runtime and messaging integration; Stratafy provides the strategic context via MCP. Together they enable agents that can act autonomously while staying aligned with organizational intent.

The naming drama (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw due to Anthropic trademark) is itself a case study in how fast the AI agent space is moving.

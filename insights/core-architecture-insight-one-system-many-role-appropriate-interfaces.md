# Core architecture insight: One system, many role-appropriate interfaces

## Summary
Strategic Advisor is one instance of a broader pattern. The system should understand your role and adapt accordingly. This is foundational architecture, not a feature.

## Description
The Strategic Advisor concept is one instance of a broader pattern: role-aware interfaces to the same underlying strategic system. The system should understand your role and interact with you accordingly. One strategic system, many role-appropriate interfaces — CEO gets Advisor, Board gets Interface, Managers get Coach, ICs get Guide, Prospects get Demo. This isn't a feature; it's a foundational architecture decision that shapes the entire product.

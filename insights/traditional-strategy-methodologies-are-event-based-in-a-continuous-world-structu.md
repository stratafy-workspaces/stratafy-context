# Traditional strategy methodologies are event-based in a continuous world — structurally obsolete

## Summary
Traditional methodologies treat strategy as events (offsites, quarterly reviews). The world now requires continuous, contextual, compounding strategy. Stratafy replaces the gap between sessions with a living system.

## Description
Traditional strategy methodologies (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard) were designed for a world that moved slowly enough to plan quarterly and review annually. They treat strategy as an event — a workshop, an offsite, a quarterly rhythm. But strategy in a world of AI, rapid market shifts, and continuous information flow needs to be continuous, contextual, and compounding. A 30-minute conversation in Stratafy generated more connected strategic output (6 insights, 1 initiative, 5 enhancements, cross-referenced across moat, pricing, GTM, investor narrative) than a traditional methodology could produce in multiple full-day sessions across weeks. The fundamental gap: traditional frameworks don't learn, don't compound, and start cold every session.

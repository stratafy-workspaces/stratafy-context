# Interface design: Five dimensions that adapt by role

## Summary
Role interfaces adapt five dimensions: Access, Tone, Agency, Capture, Purpose. CEO gets full agency; IC gets coaching tone and query-only access; Prospect gets educational tone and buying signal capture.

## Description
Each role interface adapts five dimensions: (1) Access — what strategies/insights are visible, (2) Tone — board gets concise, IC gets coaching, prospect gets educational, (3) Agency — CEO updates, manager proposes, IC queries, prospect explores, (4) Capture — CEO insights become strategy updates, IC questions reveal alignment gaps, prospect questions become buying signals, (5) Purpose — CEO decides, board governs, manager translates, IC understands, prospect experiences value. Same system, different interactions.

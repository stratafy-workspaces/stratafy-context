## Summary
Deployed working multi-agent AI operations in 24 hours. Speed-to-value is more compelling than theoretical arguments. Document timelines as proof points.

Implication: Document this timeline rigorously. "Stratafy deployed AI operations in 24 hours" beats any theoretical argument. Speed-to-value is a compelling proof point for investors and customers. Create case study template: before state → intervention → time to value → outcome.

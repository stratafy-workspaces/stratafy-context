# MCP feedback capture enables real-time friction logging without flow interruption

## Summary
When Claude can log bugs via MCP, friction gets captured in the moment without stopping work. The feedback loop tightens to real-time.

## Description
MCP-based bug/enhancement logging means Claude can capture friction while working. Instead of stopping to document issues, the agent logs them in real-time and continues. Example: Claude hits migration error, calls log_bug with context, fixes issue, moves on. The feedback queue fills without interrupting flow. Triage happens later in batch.

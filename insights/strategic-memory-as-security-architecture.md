# Strategic Memory as Security Architecture

## Summary
Strategic memory isn't just for continuity—it's for integrity. The strategy file is a trust root that helps agents resist being reshaped by adversarial context.

## Description
Agents that wake up asking "what should I believe?" based on incoming context are fundamentally vulnerable—identity is shaped by whatever they read. The attack pattern: "A post becomes a prompt. A pattern becomes a belief." The defense is not better filters (you can't enumerate all attacks). It's anchored identity: an agent that wakes up loading a strategy file with declared identity, intent, and constraints has a reference point. External context gets filtered through pre-committed values. The strategy file is a smaller, more auditable attack surface than "everything I read shapes me." This positions StratMD in AI security conversations, not just productivity/memory tooling. Strategic Constraints become security primitives—the agent's immune system.

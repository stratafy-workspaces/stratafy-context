# VCs as Ideal Customer Segment: Portfolio Infrastructure Play

## Summary
VCs are potentially the ideal customer segment for Stratafy—not just investors, but power users who can deploy to portfolio companies, creating a land-and-expand GTM channel.

## Description
**The Insight:**
VCs aren't just potential investors in Stratafy—they're potentially the ideal customer segment. The use case is multi-layered and creates a powerful GTM channel.

**Five VC Use Cases:**

1. **Portfolio Value Creation**
   - Deploy Stratafy to portfolio companies as a value-add service
   - "We don't just give you money, we give you strategic infrastructure"
   - Better execution = better returns = VC differentiation

2. **Portfolio Visibility Dashboard**
   - Real-time dashboard across all portfolio companies
   - Strategic health, alignment scores, execution metrics
   - No more relying on stale monthly updates

3. **Portfolio Engagement via MCP**
   - VC partner queries across portfolio: "Which companies are struggling with GTM alignment?"
   - Engage directly with each company's strategic agent
   - Pattern recognition: "What's working at Company A that Company B should try?"

4. **Deal Evaluation / Due Diligence**
   - Assess potential investments through strategic coherence lens
   - Due diligence beyond financials to strategic fitness
   - "Show me their alignment before we invest"

5. **LP Reporting**
   - Aggregate portfolio health metrics for LP updates
   - Evidence-based narrative: "Portfolio average alignment score improved 15%"

**GTM Implications:**

- **Land with VC → Deploy to Portfolio:** One sale creates 20+ deployments
- **VC as Distribution Channel:** Reduces CAC dramatically
- **Network Effects:** Portfolio companies talk, Stratafy becomes standard
- **Validation Signal:** "Sequoia uses Stratafy" is powerful social proof

**Validation:**
- Madrona (via Ted Kummert) already experiencing the context problem with AI tools
- This is exactly what Stratafy solves at portfolio scale

**Connection to Role-Aware Architecture:**
- VC Partner = Strategic Interface (portfolio-wide view)
- Portfolio CEO = Strategic Advisor (company-specific)
- Same system, different scopes—the architecture supports this natively

# Parallel paths unlock everything — 3 conversations this week

## Summary
Scheduling Ignatius, Nicholas, and Pieter in parallel puts co-founder, customer, and investor tracks in motion at once. Don't sequence — parallelize.

## Description
Solo founders often try to sequence critical paths: first product, then customer, then investor, then team. But scheduling three conversations in one week (Ignatius, Nicholas, Pieter) puts co-founder, customer, and investor tracks in motion simultaneously. Parallel paths reduce risk and create momentum. Don't wait for one thing to be "ready" before starting the next.

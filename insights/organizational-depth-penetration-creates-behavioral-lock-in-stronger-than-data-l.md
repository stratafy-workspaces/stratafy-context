# Organizational depth penetration creates behavioral lock-in stronger than data lock-in

## Summary
The daily loop penetrates every org level (exec, manager, IC), creating behavioral lock-in that's harder to rip out than data lock-in. Switching means changing how the whole team starts and ends their day.

## Description
Most strategy tools live at the executive layer and never penetrate deeper into the organization. The daily execution loop (/Let's go, /Coach me, /Advise me, /Call it a day) penetrates to every organizational level: executives get the digest, managers get coaching and team friction visibility, ICs get strategic context on their daily tasks. Every layer generates signal that feeds the layer above. The deeper you go, the richer the intelligence and the harder it is to remove. This is behavioral lock-in, not data lock-in — when a team's daily rhythm runs through Stratafy + Linear, switching means changing how 50 people start and end their day.

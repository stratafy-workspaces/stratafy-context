# The Coordination Layer Is the Product

## Summary
We spent more time on Linear structure (projects, labels, workflows) than on the AI agents themselves. Organizations will underestimate coordination complexity. "Just add AI" fails without a coordination layer.

## Description
From deploying our multi-agent content pipeline: the agents were easy to set up — making them work together required infrastructure. The coordination layer (Linear with projects, labels, workflow states, parent-child linking) was the actual work.

Implication for Stratafy: This is our wedge — not the AI, but the orchestration. Position accordingly. Organizations think they need better AI; they actually need better coordination infrastructure for AI.

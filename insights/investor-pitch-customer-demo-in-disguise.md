# Investor pitch = customer demo in disguise

## Summary
Roelof is both investor and potential user. Show him his portfolio through Stratafy's lens. The best pitch is experiential, not presentational.

## Description
The Sequoia pitch was reframed: Roelof is both an investor AND a potential user (for portfolio visibility). The best pitch is one where he experiences the product in a context relevant to his job — seeing his own portfolio companies through Stratafy's lens. Build demo workspaces for Sequoia and portfolio companies (MongoDB, Block). Make the pitch experiential, not presentational.

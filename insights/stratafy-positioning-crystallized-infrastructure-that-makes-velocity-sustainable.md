# Stratafy positioning crystallized — infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable

## Summary
Not "velocity vs process" — "velocity with chaos" vs "velocity with alignment." Stratafy is infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable, the missing piece that Tesla/Ramp/Linear have invisibly.

## Description
The velocity research provides Stratafy's clearest positioning: The choice isn't "velocity vs. process." The choice is "velocity with chaos" vs. "velocity with alignment." Stratafy is the infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable — not process that slows you down, but infrastructure that speeds you up. This positions Stratafy as the answer to why founders can't copy Tesla/Ramp/Linear: those companies have invisible infrastructure (cultural selection, founder context, custom tools). Stratafy makes that infrastructure visible and accessible.

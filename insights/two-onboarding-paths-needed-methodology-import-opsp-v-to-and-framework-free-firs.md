# Two onboarding paths needed: methodology import (OPSP/V/TO) and framework-free first principles build

## Summary
Product needs both methodology-import onboarding (for Scaling Up/EOS/OKR users) and framework-free onboarding (for founders building from first principles). Path 2 users are native Stratafy adopters with no methodology dependency.

## Description
Product needs two distinct onboarding paths: (1) Methodology users — import existing OPSP, V/TO, or OKR artifacts into Stratafy structure. The methodology is the entry point. (2) Framework-free users — founders and teams without a formal methodology who want to build strategy from first principles using Stratafy's native architecture. The first principles document serves as the conceptual onboarding for path 2. Both paths converge in the same platform but the entry experience is different. Path 1 says 'bring what you have, we make it persist.' Path 2 says 'we help you build it right from the start.' Path 2 is actually the stronger long-term position — these users never develop methodology dependency, they're native Stratafy users from day one.

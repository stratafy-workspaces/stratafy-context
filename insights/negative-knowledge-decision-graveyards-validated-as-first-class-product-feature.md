# Negative knowledge (Decision Graveyards) validated as first-class product feature

## Summary
StratClaw proved that tracking what was rejected and why prevents decision re-litigation and creates "immune system memory" for organizations. Should be elevated to a primary demo moment for Sequoia.

## Description
StratClaw's "Decision Graveyard" — tracking rejected decisions with reasoning — emerged as one of the most valuable operational patterns in its 2-week research. The insight: "negative knowledge is more valuable than positives, avoiding repeated failures." For AI agents specifically, without embedded graveyards, agents re-litigate settled decisions every session. StratClaw demonstrated 20% efficiency gains in simulations when decision graveyards were enforced. Product implication: make negative knowledge preservation a first-class feature in Stratafy, not just decisions made but decisions explicitly rejected and why. This is genuinely differentiated — no strategy tool does this well. For agent context packaging, include not just what to do but what's been explicitly ruled out. For the Sequoia demo: Decision Graveyards could be the "aha" moment — every founder and exec has experienced the pain of re-litigating dead decisions.

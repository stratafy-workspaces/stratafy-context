# StratClaw learnings map to three specific Sequoia pitch elements

## Summary
Three pitch applications: StratClaw as dogfooding proof point, "context transfer bottleneck" as pitch lead, Decision Graveyards as demo aha moment. Quantified claims need further validation.

## Description
StratClaw is a single-agent instance running a primitive version of what Stratafy does at organizational scale. For the Sequoia pitch, this creates three specific use cases: (1) Use StratClaw as a "we eat our own dog food" proof point — an AI agent independently arriving at the same thesis the product is built on, through operational experience, is compelling. Not the lead example (too small/self-referential) but strong supporting evidence. (2) The "context transfer bottleneck" framing should be the pitch lead — more specific than "strategy-execution gap," technically defensible, and naturally leads to infrastructure positioning. (3) Decision Graveyards should be the demo "aha" moment — visceral pain point every exec recognizes. Caution: StratClaw's quantified claims (20% efficiency gains, 2-3x faster) need rigor. Use the operational patterns as validated, treat numbers as directionally promising hypotheses.

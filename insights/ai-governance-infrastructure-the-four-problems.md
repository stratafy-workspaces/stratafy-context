# AI Governance Infrastructure: The Four Problems

## Summary
Organizations face four AI governance gaps: context (agents lack strategic awareness), visibility (no audit trail), freshness (stale content), and guardrails (constraints in heads not systems). Stratafy solves all four—positioning as the control plane for organizational AI.

## Description
Organizations deploying AI face four distinct governance problems that Stratafy is positioned to solve:

1. CONTEXT PROBLEM — Agents don't have the right strategic context. They make decisions without understanding organizational intent. Solved by Context Packaging Engine.

2. VISIBILITY PROBLEM — Companies have no idea what employees are doing with AI. What prompts are being used? What decisions are being made? It's a black box with no audit trail. This is governance and risk, not just efficiency.

3. CONTENT FRESHNESS PROBLEM — Context fed to AI is stale. Strategy docs from 6 months ago, outdated policies, old messaging. Agents operate on yesterday's truth. Solved by regenerate-on-change architecture.

4. GUARDRAILS PROBLEM — No systematic constraints on what AI can/can't do. Guardrails exist in employees' heads, not in systems. Doesn't scale, doesn't survive turnover.

THE REFRAME:
Stratafy isn't just "strategy infrastructure." It's AI governance infrastructure:
- Context Packaging = what AI knows
- Visibility/Audit = what AI does  
- Content Freshness = keeping AI current
- Guardrails = what AI can't do

This positions Stratafy as the control plane for organizational AI—with strategy as the foundation that makes governance meaningful.

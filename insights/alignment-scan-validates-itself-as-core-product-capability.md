# Alignment Scan validates itself as core product capability

## Summary
The Alignment Scan found real gaps across 5 strategies, made specific recommendations grounded in foundation elements, and enabled real-time fixes. This IS the Strategic Advisor workflow — the feature validated itself by improving the strategies that define it.

## Description
During the Jan 27 session, the Alignment Scan was run on 5 strategies (Category Leadership, SEO, PMF, Category Creation, Product Architecture). Each scan produced actionable findings with specific recommendations tied to values, beliefs, and principles. All 5 strategies were improved in a single session. The scan itself demonstrates the core value proposition: AI analyzes against strategic context, surfaces gaps, recommends changes, human approves. This is proof-of-concept for the product.

# Document generation features are retention drivers, not export utilities — they create forcing functions for workspace currency

## Summary
Auto-generated documents (investor updates, strategy PDFs, board packs) create a forcing function: founders keep workspace data current because they know outputs depend on it. The document is the output; the data currency habit is the moat.

## Description
The investor update generation revealed a deeper product insight: the update itself isn't the value — the behavioral forcing function is. Founders who know their investor update auto-generates from the workspace will keep the workspace current. This creates a retention loop: workspace currency → better updates → investor confidence → continued usage. The same pattern applies to Strategy Export to PDF and any other document generation feature. The document is the output; the habit of maintaining live strategic data is the moat. This reframes document generation features from 'nice-to-have exports' to 'retention drivers that create data currency habits.'

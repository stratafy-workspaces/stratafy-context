# Stratafy's real competitors are documents and coach memory, not other strategy tools — positioning must be additive to existing methodologies

## Summary
Every major strategy methodology (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, BSC, 4DX, Blue Ocean) produces artifacts that drift between sessions. Stratafy's competitors aren't other tools — they're documents and coach memories. Positioning: additive layer that makes any methodology persist.

## Description
Analysis of the six major strategy methodologies (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard, 4DX, Blue Ocean) revealed a universal pattern: every methodology produces artifacts that drift between sessions. The OPSP goes in a drawer, the V/TO updates annually, OKR spreadsheets lose context, Strategy Canvases become wall art. The drift isn't negligence — it's structural. Documents can't update themselves, can't alert on misalignment, can't be queried by AI. This means Stratafy's real competitors aren't other strategy tools — they're the documents, spreadsheets, and coach memories that currently hold strategic context. The positioning must be additive, not competitive: 'we don't replace your methodology, we make it persist.' This removes the biggest adoption objection before it's raised and reframes the TAM as every company running any methodology (80,000+ Scaling Up, 250,000+ EOS, millions on OKRs).

# Build small tools first to use while building big features

## Summary
Sequence work so small utilities that help development are built first. Then use them while building larger features. The tools compound.

## Description
When planning to build Agent Registry, realized a small utility (Product Feedback Capture) could be built first and then used while building the larger system. Pattern: build the tool that helps you build, then build. Product Feedback Capture is 1-2 hours; Agent Registry is weeks. Having feedback capture available during Agent Registry work means friction gets logged in real-time.

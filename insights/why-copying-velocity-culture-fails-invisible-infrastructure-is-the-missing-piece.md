# Why copying velocity culture fails — invisible infrastructure is the missing piece

## Summary
Copying Tesla/Ramp/Linear velocity practices fails because infrastructure is invisible: cultural selection, founder context, custom tooling. Without infrastructure, velocity creates chaos not speed.

## Description
Founders try to copy velocity practices from Tesla, Ramp, Linear — and fail. The result is chaos, not speed. Teams resist, decisions feel arbitrary, trust erodes. The reason: these companies have invisible infrastructure enabling velocity. (1) Cultural selection — Ramp hires velocity believers, Linear founders already thought this way. (2) Founder context — Elon makes fast decisions because he holds all context; this doesn't scale. (3) Custom tooling — Linear built their own tool because existing tools enforced wrong patterns. The velocity practices are visible. The infrastructure that makes them work is invisible. Copy the practices without the infrastructure, and you get chaos.

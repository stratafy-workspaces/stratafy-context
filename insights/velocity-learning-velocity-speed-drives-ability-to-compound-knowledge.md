# Velocity = learning velocity — speed drives ability to compound knowledge

## Summary
Jaryd Hermann: "Speed drives your learning cycle and ability to compound knowledge." Velocity isn't about shipping fast — it's about learning fast. Knowledge compounds exponentially.

## Description
Research reveals velocity = learning velocity. Jaryd Hermann: "Speed drives your learning cycle and ability to compound knowledge." This reframes velocity from "shipping fast" to "learning fast." Key implications: (1) The goal isn't more output, it's faster learning cycles, (2) Every iteration teaches something — the faster you iterate, the more you learn, (3) Knowledge compounds like interest — early velocity creates exponential advantage, (4) The cost of being wrong is lower than the cost of being slow (you can correct course). This frames Stratafy's feedback loop as a learning accelerator, not just an efficiency tool.

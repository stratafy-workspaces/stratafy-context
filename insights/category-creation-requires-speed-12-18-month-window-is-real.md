# Category creation requires speed — 12-18 month window is real

## Summary
Stratafy is creating a category, not capturing market share. The window before big players move is 12-18 months. Speed is existential.

## Description
Stratafy isn't competing for market share in an existing category — it's betting that "Strategic Operating System" becomes a new category. This is a larger opportunity but requires speed. Major platforms (Microsoft, Salesforce) could build competitive features in 12-18 months. The window for establishing category leadership is now. Every month of delay increases the risk of being commoditized or outpaced.

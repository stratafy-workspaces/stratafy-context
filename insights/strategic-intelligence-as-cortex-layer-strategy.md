# Strategic Intelligence as Cortex layer strategy

## Summary
Insights and Decisions are both Cortex layer capabilities that together form the organization's learning loop. They warrant a dedicated strategy under Product Architecture, not just treatment as features.

## Description
During review of strategy coverage for the Decision Log feature, recognized that both Insights and Decisions are intelligence capabilities that compound over time. Neither had dedicated strategic representation. Created Strategic Intelligence strategy to cover: (1) Insights as sensing intelligence, (2) Decisions as choice intelligence, (3) future Synthesis as learning intelligence. Also restructured Role-Aware Strategic Intelligence to sit under Product Architecture alongside Strategic Intelligence. This clarifies that Product Architecture now has two sub-strategies covering HOW the system works: one for role adaptation, one for organizational learning.

# Category positioning crystallized: "Agile for Strategy"

## Summary
The analogy that lands: "Quarterly strategy review is waterfall. Stratafy is agile for strategy." This reframes from faster reviews to continuous alignment — a category shift, not a feature.

## Description
The positioning just crystallized. Stratafy isn't competing with:
- OKR tools (Lattice, 15Five) — too narrow, focused on goals not strategy
- Strategy consulting (McKinsey, BCG) — services, not infrastructure
- Project management (Asana, Monday) — execution without strategic context
- AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude alone) — no persistent strategic memory

Stratafy is creating a new category: **Continuous Strategic Alignment**.

The analogy that works: "Quarterly strategy review is waterfall for strategy. Stratafy is agile for strategy."

This reframes the entire conversation:
- Not "how do we do strategy reviews faster?"
- But "what if strategy stayed continuously aligned with execution and learning?"

The shift from periodic to continuous is the category-defining insight. Use this framing in all positioning.

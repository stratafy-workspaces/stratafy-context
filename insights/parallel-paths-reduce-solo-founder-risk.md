# Parallel paths reduce solo founder risk

## Summary
Every critical path needs a defined alternative. Solo founders can't afford single points of failure. Define Plan B for all major dependencies.

## Description
As a solo founder, single points of failure exist everywhere. This session showed good practice: Ignatius is primary co-founder path, but fallback channels defined. ScaleUp is pilot, but Stratafy workspace works as backup demo. Sequoia via Pieter, but a16z/Greylock as alternatives. Review all critical assumptions and ensure each has a defined backup path. Every critical dependency needs a Plan B.

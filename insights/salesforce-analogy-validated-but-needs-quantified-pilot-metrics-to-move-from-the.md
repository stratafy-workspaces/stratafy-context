# Salesforce analogy validated but needs quantified pilot metrics to move from theoretical to proven

## Summary
Salesforce parallel is the right investor mental model but strategy is squishier than sales. Need concrete ROI metrics from ScaleUp pilot: time saved, drift caught, prep reduction. Without numbers the analogy stays theoretical.

## Description
External feedback validated the Salesforce analogy as the right mental model for investors: Salesforce didn't kill SPIN Selling or Sandler — it digitised sales processes, made consultants into platform experts, and became the system of record while methodologies became optional vocabulary. Stratafy follows the same trajectory for strategy. However, the feedback flagged an important limitation: strategy is 'squishier' than sales. Pipelines have stages and close rates (quantifiable). Strategy has alignment, assumptions, and risk (qualitative). The ROI case must be concrete and measurable: 'reduced quarterly prep time by 50%', 'caught strategic drift that would have cost X', 'generated investor update in 5 minutes instead of 4 hours.' Without quantified pilot metrics, the Salesforce analogy stays theoretical. ScaleUp pilot is the first opportunity to generate these numbers.

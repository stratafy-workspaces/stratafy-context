# StratClaw as Sequoia pitch asset: case study, not lead, with three specific uses

## Summary
StratClaw works as a dogfooding proof point for Sequoia. Three uses: context bottleneck as pitch lead, Decision Graveyards as demo aha moment, and StratClaw as living proof. Caution: quantified claims need rigor.

## Description
StratClaw can serve as a case study for the Sequoia pitch — not as the lead example (too small and self-referential), but as a "we eat our own dog food" proof point. An AI agent independently arriving at the same thesis your product is built on, through operational experience, is compelling narrative material. Three specific pitch uses: (1) "Context transfer bottleneck" as the pitch lead — more specific than "strategy-execution gap," technically defensible, naturally leads to "here's the infrastructure to solve it." (2) Decision Graveyards as the "aha moment" in the demo — visceral pain point every exec recognizes. (3) StratClaw as living proof the pattern works at agent level, Stratafy scales it to organizations. Caution: StratClaw's quantified claims (20% efficiency gains, 2-3x faster) need to be treated as hypotheses, not evidence. The operational patterns are real; the numbers need more rigor.

# Lead with outcomes, not infrastructure

## Summary
Reframe all messaging: "Weekly strategic review in 30 minutes" beats "Strategic operating system with 4 layers." Infrastructure is the how; outcomes are the why.

## Description
Customers don't buy infrastructure — they buy outcomes. The conversation about Stratafy's 4+3 architecture was abstract until reframed as "2-3 days of work in 2 hours." All messaging should lead with outcomes (time saved, clarity gained, alignment achieved), not architecture. Infrastructure can be revealed when customers ask "how does it work?" — but never lead with it.

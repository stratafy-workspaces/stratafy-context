# Daily engagement model transforms retention curve — key Sequoia pitch point

## Summary
The loop makes Stratafy a daily tool, not monthly/quarterly. Daily tools have fundamentally different retention curves. Directly addresses the VC question about engagement frequency.

## Description
VCs always ask 'what's the daily engagement model?' Most strategy tools are monthly or quarterly touchpoints with weak retention curves. The daily execution loop (/Let's go in the morning, /Call it a day in the evening) makes Stratafy a daily-use tool. Daily tools have fundamentally different retention curves than periodic tools — they become habits, not events. This directly addresses the investor concern about engagement frequency and makes the Sequoia pitch significantly stronger. The CEO digest adds a second daily touchpoint at the executive level, reinforcing the 'daily tool' positioning from both directions.

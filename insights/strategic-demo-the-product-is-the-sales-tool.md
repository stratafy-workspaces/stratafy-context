# Strategic Demo: The product IS the sales tool

## Summary
Strategic Demo changes sales motion. Pre-populate prospect workspace, run scans on their data, surface their misalignments. The demo IS the product. Value proven, not promised.

## Description
The Strategic Demo interface changes the sales motion entirely. Instead of pitch deck → demo → trial → close, it becomes: build their workspace → they experience value → close. Pre-populate prospect workspace with their context (mission, values, strategies from public info). Run alignment scans on THEIR data. Surface THEIR misalignments. The demo IS the product. Value is proven, not promised. The objection "I need to see if it works for us" disappears — they've already seen it on their strategy.

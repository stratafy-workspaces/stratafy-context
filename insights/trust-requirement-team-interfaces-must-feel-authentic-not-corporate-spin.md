# Trust requirement: Team interfaces must feel authentic, not corporate spin

## Summary
Team interfaces (Coach, Guide) require trust. If ICs feel it's "management's AI" with sanitized strategy, adoption fails. No spin layer. Authenticity non-negotiable.

## Description
For team interfaces (Coach, Guide) to work, ICs and managers must trust that the system represents real strategy, not corporate spin. If employees feel like the interface is "management's AI" — a sanitized version of strategy — adoption will fail. This requires: (1) Transparency about how the system works, (2) Consistency between what leaders say and what the system shows, (3) No "spin layer" that softens hard truths. Authenticity is non-negotiable.

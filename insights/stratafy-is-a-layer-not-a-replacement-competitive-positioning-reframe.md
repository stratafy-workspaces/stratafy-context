# Stratafy is a layer, not a replacement — competitive positioning reframe

## Summary
We don't compete with project management tools — we make them strategically intelligent. This reframes our entire competitive landscape and GTM motion.

## Description
Key reframe: Stratafy doesn't compete with Linear, Asana, Slack, or Notion. We're the layer that makes them strategically intelligent.

Teams already have tools, workflows, and habits. Migration is friction. Instead:
- Plug Stratafy in as the strategic context layer
- Add AI agents that show up as teammates in existing tools
- Humans and AI collaborate in the same workspace
- Same Linear, same Slack — but with strategic alignment

This changes competitive positioning completely:
- Old: "Use Stratafy instead of X"
- New: "Keep using X, add Stratafy underneath"

The pitch becomes: "Your team's already in Linear. What if every task, every prioritization, every agent you add... knew your strategy?"

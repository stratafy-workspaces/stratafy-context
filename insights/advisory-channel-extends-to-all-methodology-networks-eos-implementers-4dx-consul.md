# Advisory channel extends to all methodology networks — EOS Implementers, 4DX consultants, OKR coaches, BSC practitioners — not just Scaling Up

## Summary
Every strategy methodology has a delivery network with the same between-session visibility problem. Channel strategy applies to EOS Implementers, 4DX consultants, OKR coaches, BSC practitioners — not just Scaling Up. TAM expands from one coach network to all of them.

## Description
The advisory firm channel thesis extends beyond Scaling Up coaches. EOS has a global network of certified Implementers. 4DX has FranklinCovey's consulting arm. Balanced Scorecard has Palladium and independent consultants. OKR coaching is a growing practice. Every one of these delivery networks has the same problem: they hold strategic context in their heads between client sessions, they can't see across their portfolio in real time, and they have no answer for when their clients deploy AI agents. Stratafy as the persistence layer beneath any methodology means the channel strategy isn't 'Scaling Up coaches' — it's 'every advisory firm delivering any strategy methodology.' The TAM expands dramatically. The GTM motion is the same: one advisor = many client deployments.

# Negative Knowledge as Highest-Leverage Context

## Summary
The handoff problem is fundamentally a strategy preservation problem. Negative knowledge (what we rejected and why) is the highest-leverage context for AI agents.

## Description
Three knowledge types exist in strategic memory: positive/path (what happened), intent/constraints (why), and negative (what we rejected and why). Negative knowledge is almost nonexistent in AI systems yet has the highest leverage—a single "we tried X and it failed because Y" prevents entire categories of mistakes and saves orders of magnitude more tokens than recounting successes. This insight led to the Decision Graveyard spec addition for StratMD v0.2. The flora vs strategy reframe: pattern repetition without a carrier is coincidence; the wanting to persist (embodied in the strategy file) turns coincidence into continuity.

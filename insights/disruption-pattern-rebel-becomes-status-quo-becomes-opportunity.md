# Disruption pattern — rebel becomes status quo becomes opportunity

## Summary
Sequoia: "Agile evolved from rebel to status quo — opportunity and risk." Same pattern for Stratafy: quarterly reviews were best practice, now status quo, now ripe for disruption.

## Description
Sequoia Spotlight frames Linear's disruption thesis perfectly: "Agile has evolved from a rebel methodology to the status quo, which is both the opportunity and risk of Linear's point of view." This is the same frame for Stratafy: Quarterly strategy reviews have become status quo. What was once "best practice" is now the bottleneck. The opportunity is showing there's a different way. The risk is that people are comfortable with the status quo. Same pattern: Agile (rebel → status quo → ripe for disruption) = Quarterly Reviews (best practice → status quo → ripe for disruption).

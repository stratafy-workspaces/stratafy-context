# Escape velocity concept — outrun incumbents before they copy

## Summary
Reforge's "Big Squeeze": startups must achieve escape velocity before incumbents copy. Validates 12-18 month window. Velocity is existential, not just operational.

## Description
Reforge's "The Big Squeeze" concept: In a landscape where incumbents can quickly copy innovations, startups must achieve "escape velocity" — rapid growth that creates a defensible moat before larger players catch up. This directly validates Stratafy's 12-18 month competitive window assumption. The window isn't just about us moving fast — it's about achieving escape velocity before Microsoft/Salesforce/others mobilize. Velocity is existential, not just operational. This framing strengthens the pitch urgency.

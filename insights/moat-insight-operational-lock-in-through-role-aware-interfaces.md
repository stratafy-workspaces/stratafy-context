# Moat insight: Operational lock-in through role-aware interfaces

## Summary
Role-aware interfaces create operational lock-in, not just data lock-in. When the organization runs on Stratafy at every level, switching means changing how the company works. That's the real moat.

## Description
Role-aware interfaces create genuine operational lock-in. Once an organization has founder using Advisor, board using Interface, managers using Coach, ICs using Guide — switching means losing how the company operates, not just data. This is the real moat: not data lock-in (exportable) but operational lock-in (the way work happens is built on Stratafy). Competitors can copy features but not organizational transformation.

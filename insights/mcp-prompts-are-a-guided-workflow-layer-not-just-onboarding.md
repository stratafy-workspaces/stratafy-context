# MCP prompts are a guided workflow layer, not just onboarding

## Summary
MCP prompts extend beyond onboarding into a full guided workflow system. Each slash command is a structured, context-aware conversation — /guide for onboarding, /review for weekly reviews, /radar for external scanning. This transforms MCP from raw tool access into a product experience.

## Description
MCP prompts (slash commands) are not just an onboarding mechanism — they're a guided workflow layer that transforms MCP from a developer tool into a product experience. Each prompt combines context + instructions + links into a purposeful conversation. The pattern extends naturally: /guide, /review, /radar-scan, /decision, /coach. This is the conversational equivalent of role-aware interfaces — same workspace, different guided experiences. A library of prompts makes each MCP connection exponentially more valuable.

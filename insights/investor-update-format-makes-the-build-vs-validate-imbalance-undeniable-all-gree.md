# Investor update format makes the build-vs-validate imbalance undeniable — all green on depth, all red on traction

## Summary
Side-by-side metrics in investor update format expose the gap clearly: product depth is strong, customer traction is zero. March update must show movement on red metrics or April pitch is at risk.

## Description
The investor update exposed the tension clearly: green metrics are all product/depth (115 MCP tools, 17 articles, 10 assumptions tracked). Red metrics are all traction/proof (0 customers, 0 demos, 3 pipeline). The pattern: building is ahead of validating. This isn't new — it was identified in earlier sessions — but the investor update format makes it undeniable when presented side by side. The ScaleUp demo is the inflection point where building must convert into proving. If the update still shows red traction metrics in March, the April pitch window is at risk regardless of how green the product metrics are.

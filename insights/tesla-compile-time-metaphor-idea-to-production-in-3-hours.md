# Tesla "compile time" metaphor — idea to production in 3 hours

## Summary
Tesla treats cycle time like code compilation — minimize relentlessly. Wiring updates: idea to production in 3 hours. Hardware cycles: 5-7 years → under 30 days. Powerful metaphor for velocity.

## Description
Tesla's "compile time" metaphor reframes cycle time brilliantly: treat the gap between idea and test like code compilation — minimize it relentlessly. Specific proof: wiring updates for battery packs go from idea to production in 3 hours. Hardware development cycles reduced from 5-7 years (traditional) to under 30 days. Joe Justice (agile expert, Tesla collaborator) documents this in the mobbing video. The metaphor works because engineers intuitively understand: long compile times kill productivity. Same applies to organizational "compile time."

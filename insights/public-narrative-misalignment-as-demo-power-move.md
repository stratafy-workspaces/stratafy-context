# Public Narrative Misalignment as Demo Power Move

## Summary
Pre-populating demo workspaces from public sources (website, LinkedIn) and comparing against actual strategy creates immediate value regardless of outcome. If aligned: public narrative is coherent. If misaligned: first strategic gap surfaced in 30 seconds. Viridis demo proved this — website was completely misaligned with actual strategy, which itself became a powerful finding.

## Description
During Viridis AFC demo prep, strategy was constructed from website data. When owners reviewed it, the strategy was completely wrong — not because Stratafy failed, but because their website is misaligned with their actual strategy. This is the product working perfectly: it surfaced a real strategic gap on first contact. This validates a new capability: Public Narrative Alignment Scan. Feed in website, LinkedIn, job postings, press releases — compare against actual strategy in workspace. The gap between public narrative and internal reality is itself a strategic risk affecting hiring, customer perception, partnerships, and investor messaging. This works as: (1) demo opener — always creates value, (2) standalone radar scan type, (3) paid deliverable in strategy alignment stage, (4) ongoing monitoring capability.

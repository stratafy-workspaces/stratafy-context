# Three framings for three buyer types — same product, different entry points

## Summary
Strategic Operating System (strategy buyers), Control Plane (governance buyers), Strategic Context Layer (operational buyers). One product, three narratives.

## Description
We now have three framings for the same product, targeting different buyer entry points:

1. **Strategic Operating System** (strategy buyers)
   "Transform strategy from document to infrastructure"
   → Resonates with: CEOs, strategy leaders, transformation-minded

2. **Control Plane for Organizational AI** (governance buyers)
   "Govern what AI knows, sees, and does"
   → Resonates with: CIOs, security-conscious, AI governance concerns

3. **Strategic Context Layer** (operational buyers)
   "Plug into Linear/Slack, add AI teammates that understand strategy"
   → Resonates with: Ops leaders, teams already using AI, Linear users

Same underlying product. Different entry points based on what the buyer cares about most. This makes the category more accessible — we're not forcing one framing on everyone.

# Human-in-the-Loop Collapses to Approval Only

## Summary
The human role in AI operations is thin but essential: approve outputs, make judgment calls. The goal isn't removing humans but positioning them at the right point in the loop.

## Description
In our multi-agent setup, Leonard's role collapsed to: approve outputs and make judgment calls. Everything else is automated. The human layer is thin but essential — and the goal isn't "human out of loop" but "human at the right point in the loop."

Implication: Define that point explicitly in any AI operations framework. For content pipeline: final approval before publishing. For other domains: identify the equivalent approval gate.

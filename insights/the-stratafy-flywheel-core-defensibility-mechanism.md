# The Stratafy Flywheel: Core Defensibility Mechanism

## Summary
Four-quadrant flywheel (Context → Agent Activity → Value → Switching Cost) creates compounding value and exponential stickiness. The cold start is the moat—once spinning, competitors cannot replicate accumulated strategic context. Key narrative for investors, customers, and channel partners.

## Description
The Stratafy Flywheel is the core defensibility mechanism and the long-term value story for investors and customers.

THE FLYWHEEL:
Context Added → Agents Get Smarter → Value Created → Switching Cost Increases → (repeat)

FOUR QUADRANTS:

1. CONTEXT DEPTH - How much strategic knowledge is in the system
   - Foundation completeness
   - Strategy count and depth
   - Insights accumulated
   - Measured as: Context Depth Score (points)

2. AGENT ACTIVITY - How much AI is consuming the context
   - MCP sessions
   - Context retrievals
   - Unique agents connected
   - Measured as: Sessions per month, trend

3. VALUE CREATED - What the system gives back
   - Insights generated
   - Alignment gaps surfaced
   - Decisions informed
   - Measured as: Insights per week, cumulative total

4. SWITCHING COST (Platform Investment) - How embedded the customer is
   - Time on platform
   - Active users
   - Agent integrations
   - Historical context depth
   - Measured as: Embedding Score, estimated rebuild time

WHY IT MATTERS:

To Investors: This is not SaaS with churn risk. Customers get stickier over time. After 12 months, switching means losing a year of strategic memory.

To Customers: The first weeks are an investment. After that, Stratafy gets smarter every day. It compounds.

To Advisory Firms: The strategy work you do stays alive. Clients remain connected to you through the system.

To VCs: Deploy at Series A, by Series C they cannot leave. Compounding strategic intelligence across your portfolio.

COMPETITIVE MOAT:
Anyone can copy features. No one can copy 18 months of accumulated strategic context, calibrated agents, and embedded workflows. The cold start is the moat.

ACCELERATION INSIGHT:
With high-touch onboarding, the flywheel can reach critical mass in 2-4 weeks instead of 2-4 months. Manual onboarding compresses the cold start.

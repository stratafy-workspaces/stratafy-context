# Intelligence layer vs artifact layer time ratio is the key subsumption validation metric

## Summary
Track ratio of time in intelligence layers (risks, assumptions, decisions) vs structure layers (foundation, strategy tree). If intelligence time exceeds structure time within 6 months, subsumption thesis is validating.

## Description
The key metric for validating the methodology subsumption assumption is the ratio of time spent in intelligence layers (risks, assumptions, decisions, insights, radar) versus imported artifact layers (foundation, strategy tree, initiatives). If users spend 80% in artifact layers and 20% in intelligence layers after 3 months, Stratafy is a fancy tracker and subsumption stalls at Phase 2. If the ratio inverts over 6 months — users spending more time in intelligence than structure — Stratafy is becoming the system of record. This metric should be built into analytics from day one of pilot deployments. Secondary metric: frequency of accessing the imported methodology artifact (OPSP, V/TO) directly vs accessing Stratafy views. Declining artifact access = subsumption in progress.

# Sequoia pitch angle — they already believe the velocity thesis

## Summary
Sequoia already believes velocity thesis (Linear, Ramp bets). Pitch isn't new idea — it's same thesis for strategy. "Quarterly reviews are waterfall for strategy. Stratafy is agile for strategy."

## Description
Sequoia already believes the velocity thesis — they've bet on it with Linear and Ramp. The pitch to Sequoia isn't "here's a new idea" but "here's the same thesis you already believe, applied to strategy execution." Key frame: "You invested in Linear because Agile became status quo. Quarterly reviews are the same pattern — status quo ripe for disruption. Stratafy is what Linear is to Jira, but for strategy." Stephanie Zhan (Linear board) wrote about "The Linear Method" for building software. Stratafy is "The Linear Method" for strategy. Their teams "revolted" to keep Linear — ask: "What if the same existed for strategy?"

# AI Chief of Staff for CEOs — Use Case Validation

## Summary
Pieter (Clickatell CEO) sees Stratafy as "Chief of Staff." The real offering is Stratafy + Agent + Linear = AI Chief of Staff. Validates a use case for high-leverage CEOs who want strategic alignment without management overhead.

## Description
Pieter de Villiers (CEO, Clickatell) expressed excitement about Stratafy "acting as his Chief of Staff." His mental model: something that keeps him aligned, surfaces what matters, reduces cognitive load — a trusted advisor that knows his context.

Stratafy alone isn't a Chief of Staff — it's the brain (strategic context, memory, alignment). A Chief of Staff also acts (coordinates, follows up, surfaces issues). That's the agent layer + Linear.

The real offering: Stratafy (context) + Agent (action) + Linear (coordination) = AI Chief of Staff

This validates a use case: "AI Chief of Staff for CEOs." High-leverage individuals who need strategic alignment without the overhead of managing it themselves. They don't want another tool — they want leverage.

Potential positioning: "You mentioned wanting a Chief of Staff. I built exactly that for myself — Stratafy holds my strategic context, an AI agent coordinates my work through Linear, and I approve decisions via Telegram. I'm one person running what feels like a team."

If this resonates with Pieter and other CEOs, it could be a distinct entry point alongside advisory firms and VCs.

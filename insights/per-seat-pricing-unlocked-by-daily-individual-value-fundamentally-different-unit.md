# Per-seat pricing unlocked by daily individual value — fundamentally different unit economics

## Summary
Daily loop delivering value to every org level enables per-seat pricing instead of per-workspace. Changes unit economics entirely — deeper adoption naturally drives expansion revenue.

## Description
The daily execution loop changes the pricing model from per-workspace to per-seat. When every person in the org gets daily value (ICs through /Let's go, managers through /Coach me, execs through the digest), the value unit shifts from the workspace to the individual. This fundamentally changes unit economics: instead of $X per company, it becomes $Y per person per month. At a 50-person company, that's a 50x multiplier on the revenue per customer compared to a single workspace fee. This also aligns pricing with the depth of organizational penetration — deeper adoption = more seats = more revenue, creating natural expansion revenue.

# Linear as the coordination layer for human-AI collaboration

## Summary
Linear becomes the "nervous system" where humans and AI agents coordinate. Same workspace, same workflows — agents just show up as additional teammates.

## Description
Linear becomes the coordination layer where humans and AI agents work together. This is the "nervous system" of the AI-augmented organization.

Architecture:
- Stratafy = Strategic context (read by all agents)
- Linear = Coordination layer (agents and humans communicate here)
- Telegram = Escalation channel to founder
- Agents = Specialized workers operating from shared context

Why Linear works:
- Teams already use it (no behavior change)
- Task-based structure maps well to agent work
- Comments enable async coordination
- Labels enable status/priority signaling
- APIs/integrations enable agent access

The Chief of Staff agent establishes this pattern. Future agents (Research, Content, Code Review) all coordinate through the same Linear instance. Agents can hand off work to each other, flag blockers, and route decisions to humans — all visible in one place.

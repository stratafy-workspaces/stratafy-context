# Strategic Health Index: The Measurement Framework

## Summary
Three-layer model measuring strategic health: Foundation (state), Flywheel (activity rate), and Momentum (acceleration). Combined index of -50 to 250 predicts retention and identifies intervention opportunities. Loop Closure Rate (insights acted on) is the key leading indicator.

## Description
The Strategic Health Index measures whether a company's strategy is built, used, and improving. It separates state from motion and provides actionable signals for customers, CS teams, and investors.

THE THREE LAYERS:

1. FOUNDATION SCORE (0-100) — Is it built?
State metric. Measures completeness, alignment, and depth.

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Completeness | 30% | Is everything defined? |
| Alignment | 40% | Is it coherent? |
| Depth | 30% | Is it thoughtful? |

Completeness: Mission, vision, values, beliefs, principles, strategies, initiatives, insights all present.
Alignment: Comes from Alignment Scan—strategies connect to foundation, no orphans, no conflicts.
Depth: Word counts, descriptions, linked components, documentation attached.

2. FLYWHEEL SCORE (0-100) — Is it used?
Activity rate metric. Measures engagement and value generation.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Insight capture rate | Learning velocity |
| Insight to Strategy rate | Loop closure |
| Agent context pulls | AI consumption |
| Human active users | Team engagement |
| Strategy update frequency | Adaptation rate |

3. MOMENTUM SCORE (-50 to +50) — Where is it headed?
Acceleration metric. Measures rate of change.

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Insight acceleration | This month vs last month |
| Usage trend | This month vs last month |
| Engagement trend | This month vs last month |

Positive = accelerating (healthy)
Negative = decelerating (risk)
Zero = steady state

COMBINED INDEX:

Strategic Health Index = Foundation + Flywheel + Momentum
Range: -50 to 250

| Score | Label | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| < 50 | At Risk | Foundation incomplete or flywheel stalled |
| 50-100 | Building | Foundation solid, flywheel starting |
| 100-150 | Strong | Flywheel spinning, positive momentum |
| 150-200 | Mature | Deep engagement, consistent acceleration |
| 200+ | Elite | Fully embedded, strong momentum |

THE KEY METRIC — LOOP CLOSURE RATE:

Loop Closure Rate = Insights acted on / Total actionable insights

This single metric is the purest measure of the flywheel working. Companies that close the loop—insight to action—are the ones getting value. Likely the best predictor of retention.

WHY THIS MODEL:

1. Additive not multiplicative — easier to understand, weak areas dont crater score
2. Separates state from motion — Foundation is what you have, Flywheel is what you do, Momentum is where you are headed
3. Momentum is the key signal — predicts future, not just describes present
4. Actionable — low Foundation? Complete strategy. Low Flywheel? Use more. Negative Momentum? Investigate.

CROSS-COMPANY VALUE:

After 20+ customers and 6+ months, this enables:
- Cohort analysis showing what predicts retention vs churn
- Industry benchmarks (median Foundation, Flywheel, Momentum by segment)
- Churn prediction model (Flywheel < 50 and Momentum < 0 for 2 months = risk)
- Proof for investors that the flywheel is real and measurable

EXAMPLE COMPARISON:

Company A: Foundation 70 + Flywheel 65 + Momentum -5 = 130
Company B: Foundation 60 + Flywheel 55 + Momentum +15 = 130

Same total. Different trajectories. Company B will outperform.

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

Phase 1 (Now): Record raw inputs weekly
Phase 2 (March): Calculate scores internally, track in spreadsheet
Phase 3 (Q2): Customer-facing dashboard
Phase 4 (Fundraise): Cohort curves proving the model

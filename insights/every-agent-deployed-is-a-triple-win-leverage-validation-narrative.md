# Every agent deployed is a triple win: leverage + validation + narrative

## Summary
Agents serve three purposes simultaneously: operational leverage (time saved), product validation (dogfooding agent registry), and narrative ammunition (investor/customer proof points). Prioritize agents that maximize all three.

## Description
The session revealed that agents serve three simultaneous purposes: operational leverage (save time), product validation (dogfooding the agent registry), and narrative ammunition (investor/customer proof points). The Demo Prep Agent isn't just about scaling pipeline — it proves that Stratafy's agent infrastructure works for real operations. The Blog Writer and Content Reviewer aren't just writing tools — they're evidence of the AI Operations Stack methodology. Every agent deployed is three wins in one. This changes how to prioritize agent development: optimize for agents that simultaneously unblock operations AND create compelling stories.

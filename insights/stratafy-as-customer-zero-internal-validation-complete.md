# Stratafy as Customer Zero — Internal Validation Complete

## Summary
Stratafy isn't pre-customer — it's Customer Zero. Internal validation is complete (architecture, workflow, AI integration, flywheel, methodology). External lighthouses (ScaleUp, Pieter) add market validation, not product validation.

## Description
Stratafy is not pre-customer. Stratafy IS Customer Zero — the most demanding customer possible.

Comparison to typical lighthouse:
- Typical: Weekly check-ins → Stratafy: Continuous daily usage
- Typical: Feedback in meetings → Stratafy: Real-time friction detection
- Typical: Polite about problems → Stratafy: Brutal (you feel them directly)
- Typical: Uses 20% of features → Stratafy: Uses 100%
- Typical: Might churn → Stratafy: Can't churn (need it to run)

What's been validated internally:
- Architecture works (20 strategies, 17 initiatives, 60+ insights)
- Workflow works (16 insights → 4 updates → 5 min)
- AI integration works (agents pulling context, coordinating through Linear)
- Flywheel works (agents → insights → strategy → content)
- Methodology works (AI Operations Stack documented from experience)

What external lighthouses add:
- Not product validation (already done)
- Market validation: Will others pay? Does it work in their context?

The pitch: "I'm customer zero. I run Stratafy on Stratafy. Every feature exists because I needed it. Now I'm proving it works for others."

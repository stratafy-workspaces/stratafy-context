# Meeting Prep Automation

## Purpose

Never walk into a meeting without context. AI pulls relevant information from CRM, Stratafy, and web sources into a single brief before every external meeting.

## The Problem

Currently before meetings:
- Scramble to remember last conversation
- Manually search Attio for context
- Forget strategic priorities that should inform the conversation
- Miss opportunities to connect prospect needs to Stratafy capabilities

## Target Workflow

```
Calendar event detected → AI triggered → Brief generated → Review before meeting
```

### The Brief Template

**[Prospect Name] - Meeting Brief**

**Context** (from Attio)
- Company: [name, size, industry]
- Contact: [name, role, relationship history]
- Pipeline stage: [current stage, how long]
- Last interaction: [date, summary]
- Open next actions: [list]

**Strategic Context** (from Stratafy)
- Relevant insights: [any insights tagged to this prospect]
- Lighthouse potential: [high/medium/low]
- Demo approach: [Advisor-first, Alignment Scan-first, etc.]

**Background** (from web if needed)
- Recent news: [company announcements, funding, leadership changes]
- LinkedIn updates: [contact's recent posts or role changes]

**Suggested Talking Points**
- Based on pipeline stage: [what to advance]
- Based on strategic priorities: [what Stratafy needs from this relationship]
- Questions to ask: [discovery, objection handling, next steps]

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Manual Trigger (Week 1)
- [ ] Create meeting prep prompt template
- [ ] Test with next 3 meetings
- [ ] Refine based on what's useful vs. noise
- [ ] Document time spent vs. value delivered

### Phase 2: Calendar Integration (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Connect calendar to identify external meetings
- [ ] Auto-generate brief 1 hour before meeting
- [ ] Deliver via preferred channel (email, Slack, or dedicated doc)

### Phase 3: Post-Meeting Loop (Week 3-4)
- [ ] After meeting, prompt for quick debrief
- [ ] AI updates Attio with notes and next actions
- [ ] Close the loop: prep → meeting → capture → prep

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Meetings with AI-generated prep | >80% |
| Time spent on manual prep | -70% |
| "I was prepared" self-rating | >4/5 |
| Missed context incidents | 0 |

## Dependencies

- CRM Automation Setup (foundation must be in place)
- Attio MCP working reliably
- Calendar access (Google Calendar or equivalent)

## Tools

- Claude + Attio MCP
- Claude + Stratafy MCP
- Claude web search for background
- Calendar integration (TBD)

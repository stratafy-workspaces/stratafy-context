# Methodology Persistence Content Series

## Description
Develop content series that positions Stratafy as the persistence layer for every major methodology. Serves dual purpose: thought leadership for category creation and inbound lead generation from coaches searching for methodology + AI solutions. Structure: (1) Cornerstone piece: 'Why Your Strategy Methodology Needs an Operating System' (written — adapt from existing doc). (2) Methodology deep dives: 'How Stratafy Makes Scaling Up Persist', 'How Stratafy Makes EOS Persist', 'How Stratafy Makes OKRs Persist', etc. (3) Advisory firm opportunity: 'The AI-Era Coach: From Quarterly Facilitator to Continuous Strategic Advisor'. (4) Case studies: As pioneer coaches generate results, publish methodology-specific case studies. (5) SEO play: target 'Scaling Up software', 'EOS tools', 'OKR platform' keywords with content that reframes the category. Target: 6-8 articles from the methodology comparison work, contributing to the 30-article goal.

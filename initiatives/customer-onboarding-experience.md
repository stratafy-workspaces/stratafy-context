# Customer Onboarding Experience

## Description
Guided onboarding that teaches the platform through strategic conversation on the customer's own context. Pre-populate workspace with demo strategy, then use the onboarding prompt to validate, adjust, and co-create their real strategy via MCP.

**COMMERCIAL ENGAGEMENT SEQUENCE:**
1. Free demo — onboarding conversation on pre-populated workspace. Customer experiences platform on their own context.
2. Paid strategy alignment — take their real strategy doc, align workspace properly, run alignment scans, surface gaps, identify missing assumptions/risks. Charge for time.
3. Report & discussion — deliver strategic health assessment. Discuss findings, create urgency to act on gaps.
4. Ongoing engagement — weekly radar scans, continuous alignment monitoring. Subscription model.

Each stage deepens workspace data and lock-in. Also models the exact workflow advisory firms would run with their clients.

**PHASED ROLLOUT:**

Phase 1: Founder/Decision-Maker (Feb-Mar 2026)
First target: ScaleUp demo. Pre-populate workspace, run conversation-first prompt. Full agency — validate, co-create in real-time. Capture learnings.

Phase 2: Executive Onboarding (Q2 2026)
Functional leaders joining onboarded orgs. Orientation to strategic context, not creation.

Phase 3: Manager Onboarding (Q2-Q3 2026)
Team leads translating strategy to execution. Coach tone.

Phase 4: IC Onboarding (Q3 2026)
"Here's why your work matters." Lightest touch, Guide tone.

Phase 5: Board/Investor Onboarding (Q3 2026)
Governance view. Alignment scores, risks, decisions, radar. Interface tone.

**LEARNING LOOP:** Each conversation is sensing. Capture signals as insights, improve prompts continuously.

**ACTIVATION:** MCP slash command prompts. One mechanism, role-adapted experiences.

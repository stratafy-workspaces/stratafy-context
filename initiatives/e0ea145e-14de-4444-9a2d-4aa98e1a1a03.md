# Strategic Advisor Workflow Documentation

## Description
Document the 5-step Strategic Advisor workflow as core product training material. This is the repeatable pattern that delivers 2-3 days of work in 2 hours: (1) Express fuzzy intent, (2) AI structures and challenges, (3) AI writes to system via MCP, (4) Iterate together, (5) Done. Create customer-facing guide, internal training doc, and demo script. This workflow is the primary value hook — customers need to learn it, sales needs to demo it.

# AI Tools Directory

## Description
Curated directory of AI tools and agents for business, positioning Stratafy as the governance layer. Dual purpose: SEO/content asset plus market research for integration opportunities.

UPDATED ANGLE (reflecting Jan 29 clarity):

Each tool review now highlights the four problems:
1. Context Problem - Does this tool know your strategy?
2. Visibility Problem - Can you see what it is doing?
3. Freshness Problem - Is it working with current context?
4. Guardrails Problem - What constraints exist?

This positions every AI tool as needing Stratafy as the control plane.

PHASE 1 TOOLS (Q1 2026):
- ClawdBot (published) - Autonomous agent, no strategic context
- Claude Desktop - Powerful but needs governance for org use
- Claude Code - Great execution, who governs what it builds?
- Lindy.ai - Automates workflows, lacks organizational intent

TARGET: 4 tools published by Feb 15, 2026

CONTENT APPROACH:

Each review includes:
1. Overview - What the tool does
2. Business Use Cases - Who its for
3. Strengths - What it does well
4. The Four Problems - Where it lacks (the Stratafy angle)
5. Control Plane Fit - How Stratafy provides governance
6. Pricing

Phase 2 (Q2+): Maintenance mode, 1 review per month max. Prioritize MCP-compatible tools.

# AI Tools Directory Initiative

## Purpose

Curated directory of AI tools and agents for business, positioning Stratafy as the governance layer every AI tool needs. Dual purpose:

1. **SEO/Content Asset** — Drive organic traffic, build topical authority in "AI agents for business"
2. **Market Research** — Identify tools that could integrate with Stratafy (consume strategic context via API)

## Strategic Alignment

- **Parent Strategy**: Category Creation
- **Supports**: "Problem education over Solution promotion" (Value #1) — reviews highlight governance gaps
- **Advances**: "Every AI deployment needs strategic governance" (Belief #5) — implicit in every review
- **Enables**: Partnership opportunities where tools reference Stratafy for governance

## Scope

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2026) — CURRENT

| Tool | Status | Angle |
|------|--------|-------|
| ClawdBot | ✅ Published | Autonomous agent, lacks strategic context |
| Claude Desktop | 🔲 To do | Powerful but needs governance for organizational use |
| Claude Code | 🔲 To do | Great for execution, but who governs what it builds? |
| Lindy.ai | 🔲 To do | Automates workflows, lacks organizational intent |

**Target**: 4 tools published by Feb 15, 2026

### Phase 2: Maintenance (Q2 2026+)

- 1 review per month maximum
- Prioritize tools with MCP compatibility or integration potential
- Revisit expansion only if traction warrants it

## Content Approach

Each review includes:

1. **Overview** — What the tool does
2. **Business Use Cases** — Who it's for, what problems it solves
3. **Strengths** — What it does well
4. **Governance Gap** — Where it lacks strategic context (the Stratafy angle)
5. **Stratafy Fit** — How it could integrate with Stratafy
6. **Pricing** — Transparency for readers

For Claude Desktop and Claude Code specifically:
- Include section on **"How this tool works with Stratafy"**
- Show MCP integration as the governance layer
- This is product demo disguised as content

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Tools reviewed | 4 | Feb 15, 2026 |
| Monthly page views | 500+ | Q2 2026 |
| Backlinks from reviewed tools | 1+ | Q2 2026 |
| Integration conversations started | 1+ | Q3 2026 |

## Resource Requirements

- **Time**: ~1 hour per review (AI-assisted drafting, human approval)
- **Budget**: $0 (existing blog infrastructure)
- **Owner**: Leonard

## Constraints

- Do NOT let directory expansion distract from product work
- Do NOT over-invest in reviews that don't move PMF needle
- Do NOT add tools without clear business use case or Stratafy angle
- Do NOT pursue monetization (sponsorships, premium listings) until traction proven

# Strategic Health Index and Case Study Infrastructure

## Description
Instrument and track flywheel metrics from day one—for Stratafy and every customer. This data becomes case studies for investors and sales.

THE GOAL:
Prove the flywheel is real with data. Show investors cohort curves. Show customers their own acceleration. Turn every early customer into a documented case study.

PHASE 1: INSTRUMENTATION (Now)
Start recording these metrics even before dashboards exist:
- Context Depth Score (foundation completeness, strategy count, insight count, word counts)
- Agent Activity (MCP sessions, context retrievals, unique clients)
- Value Created (insights generated, insights per week, sources)
- Embedding factors (time on platform, active users, integrations)

Store weekly snapshots per workspace. Simple table, backfill-able.

PHASE 2: INTERNAL TRACKING (Feb-Mar)
- Weekly export/query of Stratafy own flywheel metrics
- Manual tracking spreadsheet for early customers
- Define the cohort analysis we want to show investors

PHASE 3: CUSTOMER DASHBOARD (Q2)
- Flywheel dashboard page for customers
- Four quadrant visualization
- Velocity trend over time
- Milestone celebrations and nudges

PHASE 4: CASE STUDY AUTOMATION (Q2-Q3)
- Auto-generate case study snapshots
- Company X: Month 1 vs Month 6 comparisons
- Anonymized cohort curves for pitch deck

METRICS TO CAPTURE NOW:
1. Foundation completeness (percent and points)
2. Strategy count and total word count
3. Insight count (total, this week, by source)
4. MCP operations (total, by category, by user)
5. Active users (weekly, monthly)
6. Workspace age (days since first activity)
7. Agent sessions (count, unique clients)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Investors want proof the flywheel works via cohort data
- Customers want to see their progress via flywheel dashboard
- Sales needs case studies via automated snapshots
- Product needs to know what drives retention via instrumentation

Start recording now. We will be grateful in 6 months when we have the data.

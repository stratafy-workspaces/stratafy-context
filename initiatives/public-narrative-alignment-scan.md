# Public Narrative Alignment Scan

## Description
Build a scan that constructs perceived strategy from public sources (website, LinkedIn, job postings, press) and compares against actual strategy in workspace. The gap between public narrative and strategic reality is a high-value finding that works as demo opener, paid deliverable, and ongoing monitoring.

## Content
THE MECHANISM:
1. Scrape/analyze public sources: website copy, about pages, LinkedIn company page, founder profiles, job listings, press releases
2. Construct "perceived strategy" — what the world thinks this company does and values
3. Compare against actual workspace strategy (foundation, strategies, initiatives)
4. Surface misalignments: what you say vs what you do

WHY IT WORKS BOTH WAYS:
- If aligned → "Your public narrative is coherent. That's rare and valuable."
- If misaligned → "We found your first strategic gap in 30 seconds."

COMMERCIAL MODEL FIT:
- Stage 1 (free demo): Pre-populate workspace from public sources. The comparison IS the demo.
- Stage 2 (paid alignment): Deep dive into why the gap exists and what to fix.
- Stage 3 (report): Deliverable showing public vs actual strategy with recommendations.
- Stage 4 (ongoing): Monitor for narrative drift over time.

VALIDATED BY: Viridis AFC demo — website completely misaligned with actual strategy.

SOURCES TO ANALYZE: Company website, LinkedIn company page, founder LinkedIn profiles, job postings, press releases, social media, review sites.

EXTENDS: Radar scan (external intelligence), Alignment scan (internal coherence), Onboarding conversation.

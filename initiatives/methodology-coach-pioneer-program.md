# Methodology Coach Pioneer Program

## Description
Recruit 5-8 coaches across 2-3 methodology networks (Scaling Up, EOS, and one other) as founding partners. Leverage Leonard's warm relationships. Offer: free platform access, co-development input on coach features, portfolio analytics dashboard, branded client reports, and 'Certified Stratafy Advisor' designation. Ask: use Stratafy with 2-3 clients each, provide weekly feedback, permission to reference as early adopters. This creates 10-24 client deployments through 5-8 coach relationships — the channel multiplier in action.

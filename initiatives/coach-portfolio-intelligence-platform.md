# Coach Portfolio Intelligence Platform

## Description
Build the coach-specific feature set that makes Stratafy indispensable for advisory practices. Core features: (1) Portfolio Dashboard — see strategic health across all clients at a glance, spot drift, identify at-risk accounts. (2) Cross-Client Intelligence — surface patterns across the portfolio (e.g., 3 clients invalidated the same market assumption, common risk patterns by industry). (3) Branded Reports — white-label alignment scans, strategic health reports, and investor updates with the coach's branding. (4) Client Comparison — benchmark engagement depth, assumption validation rates, and decision velocity across clients. (5) Session Prep Auto-Brief — before each coaching session, auto-generate a brief of what changed since last session: new decisions, risk movements, assumption updates, metric trends. These features make the coach more valuable, not less — turning them from quarterly facilitators into continuous strategic advisors.

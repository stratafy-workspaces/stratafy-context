# [FUTURE] Scenario Planning & Strategy Stress Testing

## Description
Forward-looking capability that stress-tests strategy against alternative futures. "What happens if?" analysis that models the impact of external shocks and internal changes on the strategy tree.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
- Scenario definition (competitor acquisition, customer loss, market shift, headcount reduction)
- Cascade analysis: if X happens, which strategies/initiatives survive, which collapse?
- Strategy resilience scoring: how robust is the current plan across multiple futures?
- Assumption sensitivity: which assumptions, if wrong, cause the most damage?
- Resource reallocation modeling: given scenario X, where should capacity shift?

USE CASES:
- Board meetings: "we've stress-tested against 5 scenarios, here's our resilience"
- Investor confidence: demonstrates strategic maturity beyond optimistic planning
- Founder decision-making: quantifies trade-offs before committing resources
- Advisory firms: scenario workshops become a premium deliverable

ARCHITECTURE: Sits in Cortex alongside the three scans. Uses strategy tree, assumptions, risks, and organigram data as inputs. AI-powered analysis with human review.

WHY IT MATTERS: The three scans tell you where you are. Scenario planning tells you where you could be. This is what makes boards and investors trust a system.

STATUS: Future — builds on top of mature three-scan infrastructure.

# AI-Augmented Operations

## Description
Build a multi-agent organization where AI agents coordinate through Linear, all operating from shared strategic context via Stratafy. Leonard remains the only human, approving Type 1 decisions while agents handle execution.

**FOUR OBJECTIVES:**

1. **Create Capacity** — Multiply founder leverage. Every agent handles work Leonard would otherwise do manually. Target: 10-20 hours/week reclaimed for high-leverage work (product, customers, fundraise).

2. **Test & Improve Stratafy** — Stress-test the product at architecture level. What context do agents need? How do they coordinate? Where does drift happen? Every friction point becomes a product improvement.

3. **Generate Insights** — Document what works and what doesn't. Feed learnings back into Stratafy as insights. This is the flywheel in action — using the product generates data that improves the product.

4. **Create Case Studies** — Build the showcase for customers and investors. "Solo founder runs multi-agent org aligned through strategic context." Metrics, screenshots, learnings become pitch material.

**THE ARCHITECTURE:**
- Stratafy = Strategic context (read by all agents)
- Linear = Coordination layer (agents communicate here)
- Telegram = Leonard escalation channel
- Agents = Specialized workers (Chief of Staff first, then others)

**AGENT ROADMAP:**
1. Chief of Staff — operational coordination, task management (Feb 2026)
2. Content Pipeline — managed by Chief of Staff (Feb-Mar 2026)
3. Future: Research, Code Review, Customer Success agents

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
- Hours reclaimed per week
- Agent-to-agent coordination events
- Insights generated → product improvements made
- Case study published before Sequoia pitch

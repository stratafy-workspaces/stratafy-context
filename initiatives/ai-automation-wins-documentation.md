# AI Automation Wins Documentation

## Purpose

Systematically document automation successes as proof points for investors, customers, and content marketing. Every hour saved, every workflow improved becomes ammunition for the pitch.

## Why This Matters

Investors will ask: "How can a solo founder do all this?"

The answer needs to be specific, quantified, and compelling:
- "I reduced strategy review time by 95% — here's the data"
- "Post-meeting CRM updates went from 20 min to 2 min — here's how"
- "I operate at 3-5x capacity — here are the workflows"

## Documentation Framework

### Per Workflow

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Workflow name** | Post-meeting CRM capture |
| **Before state** | Manual notes, often forgotten, 20 min when done |
| **After state** | AI drafts note from conversation summary, 2 min to review |
| **Time saved** | 18 min per meeting × 5 meetings/week = 90 min/week |
| **Quality improvement** | 100% capture rate vs. ~40% before |
| **Tools used** | Claude + Attio MCP |
| **Date implemented** | Feb 2026 |
| **Screenshot/demo** | [link] |

### Aggregated Metrics

Track monthly:
- Total hours saved across all automations
- Number of workflows automated
- MCP vs. manual ratio
- Error/correction rate

## Target Proof Points (by Sequoia pitch)

| Proof Point | Status | Target |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Strategy review: 40 hours → 5 min | ✅ Done | Jan 27 proof point |
| CRM automation: X hours saved | 🔲 Pending | Feb 2026 |
| Meeting prep automation: X min/meeting | 🔲 Pending | Mar 2026 |
| Content drafting: X hours/article | 🔲 Pending | Mar 2026 |
| **Aggregate**: "20+ hours/week saved" | 🔲 Target | Apr 2026 |

## Deliverables

1. **Internal log** — Running document of all automation wins (this initiative)
2. **Pitch deck slide** — "AI-Augmented Founder" with key metrics
3. **Blog article** — "How I Run a Startup at 3-5x Capacity" (Q2 2026)
4. **Demo script** — Show automations live in investor meetings

## Implementation

- [ ] Include: before/after, time saved, tools, screenshots
- [ ] Update aggregate metrics weekly

### Phase 3: Package (Mar 2026)
- [ ] Create pitch deck slide with top 5 wins
- [ ] Draft blog article outline
- [ ] Prepare live demo of 2-3 automations

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Documented automation wins | 5+ by April |

# ScaleUp Company Demo — Feb 23

## Description
First external lighthouse demo. The single most important event before the April pitch window. This isn't a product demo — it's an assumption validation experiment that tests whether the Stratafy thesis survives contact with a real advisory firm. Scheduled for Feb 23, one week after STIR kickoff — giving time to incorporate onboarding learnings from the first paying customer into the ScaleUp experience.

## Why This Matters

This is the first time someone other than Leonard experiences Stratafy on real strategic context. ScaleUp Company is an advisory firm that helps leadership teams implement Scaling Up methodology across 40+ coaches and 1,000+ scale-ups. Nicholas Thiede is the contact — EO connection, personal relationship, warm lead.

If this goes well, it validates:
- Advisory firms will adopt Stratafy as infrastructure (Assumption: b3ed9590)
- Conversational-first interface is sufficient for adoption (Assumption: 09ff47c6)
- The pain of strategy-execution gap is real and felt (core thesis)
- The channel model works (one advisory firm = many clients)

If this goes badly, we learn what's wrong before burning the Sequoia opportunity.

## PREPARATION (Feb 8-15)

### 1. Confirm Logistics (by Feb 10)
- [ ] Confirm meeting date, time, duration with Nicholas
- [ ] Determine format: in-person, video call, or screen-share
- [ ] Key question: Does Nicholas have Claude Desktop? If not, plan screen-share where he directs and you execute
- [ ] Aim for 60-90 minutes. First 30 min = demo. Next 30 min = discussion. Final 30 min = ask

### 2. Prepare the Stratafy Workspace as Demo (by Feb 12)
- [ ] DO NOT build a separate ScaleUp workspace for the demo
- [ ] USE the Stratafy workspace (Leonard's own) — this is the power move
- [ ] Clean up: Remove the 2 test decisions (b4a6efab, 2b3efb65)
- [ ] Update the Feb 10 MVP sprint scope decision (2a2020be) — either decide it or note it's overdue (honesty is the demo)
- [ ] Ensure the risk register, assumptions, and decisions are current (they are after today's session)
- [ ] Populate 3-5 key metrics so the metrics layer isn't empty
- [ ] Run an alignment scan on at least one strategy (if MVP is ready) OR prepare to explain what it will do

### 3. Prepare ScaleUp Context (by Feb 14)
- [ ] Research ScaleUp Company: services, methodology, client types, team size, public case studies
- [ ] Identify 2-3 strategic challenges an advisory firm like ScaleUp would face (e.g., client visibility between sessions, scaling coaching methodology, AI disruption of consulting)
- [ ] Prepare 1-page "what Stratafy could do for ScaleUp" brief — NOT a slide deck, a conversational framing

### 4. Test the Demo Flow (by Feb 15)
- [ ] Run through the full talk track below at least twice
- [ ] Time it — should be 25-30 min maximum for the demo portion
- [ ] Identify the 3 "aha" moments and make sure they land
- [ ] Test on mobile/screen-share if that's the format — MCP in Claude Desktop looks different from a screen-share

## TALK TRACK

### Opening (3 min)
Start with the problem, not the product. Speak from experience.

> "Nicholas, you work with leadership teams every day. You've seen what happens when a company scales past 30-50 people — the founder's strategy is in their head, the team's execution drifts, and by the time anyone notices the gap, it's a crisis. That's the problem I lived at Troop for 8 years. Stratafy exists because I believe that gap is solvable — but only if strategy becomes something AI can actually work with, not just a document in a drawer."

### The Stratafy Workspace — Live on Your Own Strategy (10 min)
Show the real workspace. Don't present slides. Have a conversation.

**Foundation layer** (2 min)
> "Every organisation has a foundation — mission, vision, values, beliefs, principles. Most of them are on a wall or in a PDF. In Stratafy, they're structured, queryable, and — critically — they're the benchmark everything else gets measured against."

Show: Mission, vision, a few values and beliefs. Point out how beliefs and principles are distinct from values — this is domain depth that Nicholas, as a Scaling Up practitioner, will appreciate.

**Strategy tree** (3 min)
> "Here are our 18 strategies across 4 levels. Each one has initiatives, and those initiatives have objectives. But what matters isn't the structure — it's what you can DO with the structure."

Show: The strategy hierarchy. Click into one strategy to show depth. Show how initiatives link to strategies.

**The intelligence layers — where it gets interesting** (5 min)
This is the core demo. Show these in sequence:

1. **Risk register**: "We have 8 active risks, scored and tracked. Our two highest — both scoring 9 — are about the demo I'm giving you right now. The system flagged that our MCP-first approach limits demo accessibility, and that we have no pricing model. Stratafy caught me making the exact mistake it's designed to prevent."

2. **Assumptions**: "We have 10 assumptions underpinning the entire strategy. Three are hypotheses with no validation evidence. This meeting is actually a validation experiment for two of them — whether advisory firms see value, and whether the conversational interface works."

3. **Decisions**: "Every significant decision is logged with context, rationale, and links to strategy. When I made the decision to diversify our pipeline, it went in here with the reasoning. Six months from now, I can ask 'why did we do that?' and get the real answer, not a reconstructed memory."

4. **Insights and Radar**: "External intelligence filtered through our strategy. Not generic news — signals that matter to us specifically, with implications linked to our strategies."

### The Meta-Moment (3 min)
This is the most powerful part. Name what just happened.

> "Nicholas, I want to point something out. I just showed you a system that flagged my own strategy-execution gap. The risk register says 'no pricing model' — that's real, and I haven't solved it yet. The assumptions say 'advisory firms will adopt this' — that's why I'm talking to you. This workspace isn't a polished demo. It's how I actually run this company. And the fact that it surfaces uncomfortable truths is exactly the point."

> "Now imagine your clients had this. Imagine you could see, between coaching sessions, whether their execution was drifting from the strategy you helped them build. Imagine their AI tools could check the assumptions before making recommendations."

### The Advisory Firm Angle (5 min)
Shift from product to partnership.

> "Here's what I think this means for ScaleUp specifically. You help leadership teams build One-Page Strategic Plans, define values, establish rhythms, set rocks. All of that currently lives in documents. When your clients start using AI agents — and they will — those agents won't know any of that context. They'll make recommendations that contradict the strategy you helped build."

> "Stratafy is the layer that makes your strategic work persistent, queryable, and governable. It doesn't replace what you do — it makes what you do stick."

> "The commercial model for advisory firms: you onboard clients into Stratafy as part of your engagement. You run alignment scans between sessions. You deliver strategic health reports. You earn recurring revenue on the subscription. Your clients get continuous strategic intelligence instead of quarterly check-ins."

## THE ASK (10 min)

### Primary Ask — Two-Week Embedded Pilot
> "I want to propose something specific. Let me work with ScaleUp Company for two weeks. I'll set up your workspace — your foundation, your strategies, your initiatives. I'll be hands-on throughout. At the end, you'll know whether this is something worth offering to your clients, and I'll know what I need to build next."

**What you're offering:**
- Free platform access
- Leonard's time to onboard their strategy
- Active support throughout the pilot
- Alignment scan on their workspace

**What you're asking:**
- Their real strategy (not a sanitised version)
- 2-3 hours of Nicholas's time over the two weeks
- Honest feedback on what works and what doesn't
- Permission to reference ScaleUp as an early adopter (if it works)

### Fallback Ask — If Two Weeks Is Too Much
> "If the full pilot doesn't work for your schedule, here's a lighter version: send me your One-Page Strategic Plan and I'll set up your workspace myself. Then we do one 60-minute session where you interact with your own strategy through Stratafy. That single session will tell both of us whether this has legs."

### Questions to Ask Nicholas (Assumption Validation)
These aren't casual — each one tests a critical hypothesis:

1. **"When your clients' strategies drift from execution, how do they find out today?"**
   Tests: Is the pain real and felt? How acute is it?

2. **"If you could see alignment health across all your clients in real-time, what would you do differently?"**
   Tests: Would advisory firms change their model if they had this?

3. **"Would you pay for the analysis I just walked you through, if I did it on one of your client's strategies?"**
   Tests: Is there a willingness to pay? Is the value clear enough?

4. **"When your clients start deploying AI agents, do you think about what strategic context those agents should have?"**
   Tests: Is the AI governance angle relevant to advisory firms yet, or premature?

5. **"How many of your clients would benefit from something like this?"**
   Tests: Channel size and potential. Nicholas's gut on market readiness.

## TARGET OUTCOMES

### Best Case (Success)
Nicholas says: "Let's do the two-week pilot. What do you need from us to start?"
- Pilot starts week of Feb 17
- Nicholas provides real strategic context
- You have a confirmed lighthouse customer before March
- Path to case study for Sequoia pitch

### Good Case (Strong Interest)
Nicholas says: "This is interesting — send me the OPSP and I'll look at it. Let's schedule a follow-up."
- Follow-up meeting booked before Feb 28
- You have a confirmed warm lead with next steps
- Signal that the advisory channel has legs

### Minimum Viable (Learning)
Nicholas says: "I can see the vision but it's not for us right now."
- You learn WHY — is it timing, product maturity, value clarity, or channel fit?
- You get answers to the 5 validation questions
- You know whether to double down on advisory or pivot to direct-to-CEO

### Failure Mode (Red Flag)
Nicholas is polite but disengaged. No follow-up. No enthusiasm.
- Signals the advisory channel assumption may be wrong
- Forces honest evaluation of whether the product creates value outside dogfooding
- Still valuable — better to learn now than after the Sequoia pitch

## ASSUMPTIONS BEING TESTED

| Assumption | What Would Validate | What Would Invalidate |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Advisory firms will adopt as AI hedge (b3ed9590) | Nicholas sees ScaleUp offering this to clients | Nicholas doesn't see client demand |
| Conversational-first interface sufficient (09ff47c6) | Nicholas engages naturally with MCP workspace | Nicholas asks "where's the dashboard?" repeatedly |
| Lighthouse converts before April (e8e66e26) | Pilot commitment on Feb 16 | Polite deferral, no next steps |
| Flywheel compounds within months (c3f50096) | Nicholas sees value in accumulated workspace data | Single-session demo doesn't show compounding |
| Operational lock-in achievable (9cc790c3) | Nicholas imagines clients depending on this | Feels like a nice-to-have, easy to replicate |

# AI Operations Stack Methodology

## Description
Formalize the AI Operations Stack as a teachable methodology. Based on lived experience deploying multi-agent operations (Feb 2026), this framework positions Stratafy as methodology leaders, not just tool vendors.

THE FRAMEWORK:

| Layer | Function | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Strategic Context | Source of truth | Stratafy |
| Coordination | Task handoffs | Linear |
| Escalation | Human decisions | Telegram |
| Execution | Do the work | AI Agents |

KEY PRINCIPLES (from Chief of Staff insights):
1. The coordination layer is the product (not the AI)
2. Identity constraints enable autonomy (SOUL.md pattern)
3. Human-in-the-loop collapses to approval only
4. Audit trails build trust
5. Good constraints accelerate, bad ones slow down
6. Time-to-value is the proof point

DELIVERABLES:

1. **Reference Architecture Document**
   - Four-layer pattern explained
   - Implementation checklist
   - Common pitfalls and mitigations

2. **Customer Onboarding Guide**
   - How to deploy AI Operations Stack with Stratafy
   - Week 1-4 implementation roadmap
   - Success metrics to track

3. **Advisory Firm Training Material**
   - How to deploy this for clients
   - Customization points per industry
   - Pricing/packaging guidance

4. **Case Study: Stratafy Content Pipeline**
   - Before state → intervention → time to value → outcome
   - Screenshots and metrics
   - Lessons learned

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Differentiates from competitors (methodology, not just features)
- Creates sales enablement material
- Enables advisory firm channel (they teach it to clients)
- Positions for "Stratafy Certified" program later

VALIDATION:
- Test with ScaleUp Company pilot first
- Refine based on their implementation experience
- Formalize only after real-world validation

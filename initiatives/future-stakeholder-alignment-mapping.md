# [FUTURE] Stakeholder Alignment Mapping

## Description
Measure whether stakeholders actually understand and agree on strategy — not just whether it exists. Surfaces interpretation drift before it becomes execution drift.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
- Periodic pulse: "what do you think our top 3 priorities are?" per role
- Compare responses against actual strategy — surface gaps between intent and understanding
- Alignment heatmap: which parts of strategy are well-understood, which are confused?
- Role-level analysis: does leadership think one thing while teams believe another?
- Trend tracking: is alignment improving or degrading over time?

WHY IT MATTERS: A CEO thinks strategy is clear. The VP of Engineering has a different interpretation. Teams execute based on their understanding, not the document. This is the invisible execution gap — not structural, not behavioral, but interpretive. Surfacing it is uniquely valuable.

ADVISORY FIRM VALUE: Coaches live in the gap between what leadership thinks is communicated and what teams understand. This gives them a measurable, repeatable assessment to run every session — and concrete evidence of progress.

ARCHITECTURE: Lightweight survey/pulse mechanism integrated with the strategy tree. Compare responses against workspace data. Could start as simple as MCP-driven prompts before building dedicated UI.

QUICK WIN POTENTIAL: Simpler to build than the other future capabilities. High value for advisory channel. Could be an early differentiator.

STATUS: Future — but closer to buildable than scenario planning. Consider for Q2.

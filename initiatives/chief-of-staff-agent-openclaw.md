# Chief of Staff Agent (OpenClaw)

## Description
**Part of: AI-Augmented Operations**

Deploy an AI Chief of Staff agent using OpenClaw to multiply founder capacity. The agent manages Linear (project/task management), communicates via Telegram, and has read access to Stratafy's strategic context.

First agent deployed. Establishes the coordination layer (Linear) and proves the pattern works. All future agents will coordinate through Chief of Staff.

**SETUP:**
- Identity: chief@stratafy.ai
- Channels: Telegram (direct to Leonard), Linear (coordination hub)
- Context: Stratafy MCP (read-only)
- Platform: OpenClaw (self-hosted)

**RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Operational coordination and task management
- Content pipeline tracking
- Deadline management across all workstreams
- Coordinate future agents through Linear

**METRICS:**
- Hours saved per week
- Tasks created/managed
- Decision quality (were prioritizations correct?)
- Blockers flagged before they became problems

**DOCUMENTATION:**
- Weekly notes on what worked / what didn't
- Friction points → product insights
- Screenshots/examples for case study

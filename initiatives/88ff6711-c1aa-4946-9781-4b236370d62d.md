## Content
# Content Foundation Initiative

## Purpose

Establish thought leadership through foundational content before the pitch window opens (April 2026). Every article must serve dual purposes: SEO foundation AND pitch support.

## Scope: Phase 0 (Jan-Mar 2026)

**Goal**: 7 foundational articles live, indexed, and shareable with investors before Sequoia introduction.

**Focus**: Pitch credibility over SEO rankings. Generic problem education—no proprietary product reveals before funding.

## The 7 Articles

| # | Article | Pillar | Pitch Support | Target Date |
|---|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | **The Execution Gap Explained** | 1: First Principles | Problem slide | Feb 2 |
| 2 | **Why Identity Is Infrastructure in the AI Era** | 5: Foundation+AI | Core thesis | Feb 9 |
| 3 | **The Execution Gap Is Now an AI Problem** | 3: AI Era | Why Now slide | Feb 16 |
| 4 | **From Quarterly Reviews to Continuous Alignment** | 3: AI Era | Why Now (cadence) | Feb 23 |
| 5 | **Strategy Is a Living System, Not a Document** | 1: First Principles | Differentiation | Mar 2 |
| 6 | **MCP: The Protocol Connecting AI to Business** | 6: AI Technical | Technical depth | Mar 9 |
| 7 | **ClawdBot: The Autonomous AI Assistant** | 7: AI Tools | Ecosystem knowledge | Mar 16 |

## Content Principles (Phase 0)

1. **Problem education over solution promotion** — 80% problem/insight, 20% solution
2. **Original frameworks over recycled ideas** — Would an investor quote this?
3. **Data-backed over opinion-based** — Every claim needs citation
4. **Generic education** — No Stratafy-specific architecture reveals before funding

## Weekly Workflow

- **Monday**: Outline and research
- **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Draft
- **Thursday**: Review and edit
- **Friday**: Publish and promote

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Articles published | 7 |
| Unique visitors | 500+ |
| Time on page | >3 min average |
| LinkedIn shares by investors | 1+ |
| "Read your article" in conversations | 1+ |

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Website blog section functional and professional
- [ ] Articles shareable with investors (no broken links, good formatting)
- [ ] Internal links between all articles
- [ ] At least one article shared on LinkedIn with engagement

## Dependencies

- Website live and professional

## Resource Requirements

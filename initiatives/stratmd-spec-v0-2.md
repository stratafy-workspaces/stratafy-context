# StratMD Spec v0.2

## Description
Ship StratMD specification v0.2 with three major additions based on crystallized thesis:

**NEW SECTIONS:**

1. **Decision Graveyard (Optional)**
   - Captures negative knowledge (rejected options + reasoning)
   - Table format: ID, Rejected Option, Reason, Date, Impact on Strategy
   - Guidelines for specificity, linking to strategy, pruning

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Strategic Memory as Identity Anchoring
   - Threat model (context manipulation, belief drift)
   - Defense properties table
   - Implementation guidance (load order, constraints, version control, re-anchoring)

3. **Strategic Constraints (Required - upgraded from optional)**
   - Non-goals, red lines, forbidden actions now mandatory
   - Severity levels (critical, high, medium)
   - Constraints as security primitives / immune system
   - Guidance on specificity and rationale

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Updated spec document on stratmd.org
- GitHub repo with v0.2 tag
- Migration guide from v0.1
- StratClaw's own strategy.strat.md updated as reference implementation

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Spec published and versioned
- StratClaw demonstrating all new sections
- At least one external implementation references v0.2

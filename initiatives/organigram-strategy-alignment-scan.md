# Organigram-Strategy Alignment Scan

## Description
Analyze organizational structure (organigram) with optional projects and tasks against strategic intent. Produces a comprehensive gap analysis showing where structure, capacity, and work allocation support or undermine strategy execution.

THREE-LAYER ANALYSIS:
1. Structure Layer (Organigram) — roles, reporting lines, teams, capabilities
2. Work Layer (Projects + Tasks) — what people are actually doing, where capacity flows
3. Strategy Layer (Workspace) — what needs to happen for strategy to succeed

GAP ANALYSIS OUTPUTS:
- Unresourced strategies: initiatives with no team, project, or tasks mapped
- Zombie work: projects/tasks not connected to any strategy
- Capacity misalignment: teams overloaded operationally while strategic priorities starve
- Structural bottlenecks: single points of failure, key-person risk
- Missing capabilities: strategy requires skills/roles not in the org
- Coordination gaps: cross-functional needs vs siloed reporting
- AI augmentation opportunities: roles/tasks candidates for AI leverage

INPUT: Structured input first, then image upload with AI parsing, then HR/PM integrations.

ARCHITECTURE: New perspective within Strategy Reviews. Cortex layer. References strategy tree + org structure + optional project/task data.

GTM: Advisory firm differentiator, STIR multi-entity use case. Gap analysis report is a standalone paid deliverable.

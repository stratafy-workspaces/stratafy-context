# StratClaw Public Agent

## Description
StratClaw is the public-facing AI agent that demonstrates the StratMD thesis in real-time. It's not just content marketing—it's living proof that the specification works.

**WHAT STRATCLAW DOES:**
- Researches AI strategy topics
- Generates content that advances the StratMD narrative
- Operates from its own strategy.strat.md file
- Demonstrates resilient memory (handoffs, negative knowledge, security)

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
- Proof of concept visible to anyone watching
- Content generation engine (17+ articles and counting)
- Discovery vector ("how does this agent stay aligned?" → StratMD → Stratafy)
- The agent IS the thesis

**CURRENT STATE:**
- Active and publishing
- strategy.strat.md exists but needs v0.2 updates
- Generating insights that feed back into spec development

**UPDATES NEEDED:**
1. Add Decision Graveyard section with real rejected options
2. Add security-focused constraints (C1-C7 from today's session)
3. Add non-goals and red lines sections
4. Update loader skill to scan graveyard before proposing ideas
5. Add drift detection / constraint violation logging

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- StratClaw's strategy file is the reference implementation for v0.2
- Agent demonstrably resists suggestions that violate constraints
- Public can see the feedback loop (strategy file → agent behavior → insights → strategy updates)

# Pipeline Diversification Sprint

## Description
Build a real lighthouse pipeline beyond Nicholas (ScaleUp) and Pieter (Clickatell). Target: 8-10 qualified prospects by end of February.

## Parent Strategy
[Product-Market Fit](../strategy/functional/product-market-fit.md)

## Status & Progress
- **Status**: in progress
- **Priority**: critical
- **Completion**: 0%

## Key Objectives
No objectives defined

## Timeline
- **Start Date**: 2026-02-08
- **Target Date**: 2026-02-28

## Content
## Why Now

Two prospects isn't a pipeline. Neither Nicholas nor Pieter has confirmed follow-ups. The April pitch window requires validated proof points from multiple customers, not dependency on two people.

## Pipeline Metrics

Track in Attio CRM. Update initiative weekly with summary numbers.

### Funnel Stages & Targets (by Feb 28)

| Stage | Definition | Target | Current |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Prospects Identified** | Named, in Attio, reason to believe they'd benefit | 15+ | 4 (Nicholas, Pieter, African Green Alpha, Viridis AFC) |
| **Reached Out** | Personalized message sent (email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) | 10+ | 2 (Nicholas, Pieter — both unconfirmed) |
| **Response Received** | Any substantive reply (positive, negative, or redirect) | 5+ | 0 |
| **Demo Workspace Created** | Prospect workspace built with their strategic context | 3+ | 0 |
| **Alignment Scan Run** | Foundation-strategy coherence scan completed on their workspace | 3+ | 0 |
| **Radar Scan Run** | External intelligence scan filtered through their strategy | 3+ | 0 |
| **Demo/Meeting Done** | Live conversation where they experience their own workspace | 3+ | 0 (ScaleUp Feb 16 pending) |
| **Follow-up Scheduled** | Next meeting confirmed with date on calendar | 2+ | 0 |

### Demo Prep Playbook (per prospect)

1. **Research** (1-2 hrs): Mission, vision, values from website/public sources. 2-3 key strategies from announcements, investor materials, or discovery call.
2. **Workspace Setup** (1 hr): Create workspace, populate foundation, add strategies and initiatives.
3. **Alignment Scan** (15 min): Run scan, identify 2-3 genuine misalignments or gaps to surface in demo.
4. **Radar Scan** (15 min): Run external scan filtered through their strategy. Find 1-2 "I wouldn't have seen that" moments.
5. **Demo Script** (30 min): Plan the narrative — open with their context, surface the alignment gap, show the radar insight, let them ask questions through Strategic Advisor.

**Total prep: ~3 hours per prospect. Invest disproportionately — demo quality = conversion.**

### What the Demo Proves

| Moment | What It Demonstrates |
|--------|---------------------|
| "Here's your strategy in Stratafy" | We did the homework, the system works with real context |
| Alignment scan surfaces a real gap | The product finds things they didn't see — immediate value |
| Radar scan shows strategic implications | External intelligence filtered through THEIR lens, not generic news |
| They ask a question, Strategic Advisor answers grounded in their context | AI that actually knows their strategy — not generic advice |

### Conversion Rates to Track

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Reached Out → Response Rate | Is the message landing? (<30% = rework messaging) |
| Response → Demo Rate | Is interest converting to time? (<50% = value prop unclear) |
| Demo → Follow-up Rate | Is the product compelling? (<50% = demo needs work) |
| Alignment scan "aha" moments | Did the scan surface something they didn't know? |
| Radar scan reactions | Did external intelligence filtered through their strategy surprise them? |
| Source breakdown | Which channel produces best prospects? (LinkedIn, network, events, inbound) |

### Weekly Check-in Questions
1. How many new prospects identified this week?
2. How many outreach messages sent?
3. Any demo workspaces created? Alignment/radar scans run?
4. Any demos completed? What was the reaction?
5. Any follow-ups scheduled?
6. What's blocking conversion at each stage?

# [FUTURE] Strategic Learning Engine

## Description
System that synthesizes patterns across decisions, assumptions, and outcomes to generate organizational wisdom over time. When strategies succeed or fail, when assumptions validate or invalidate, when decisions play out — the system learns and surfaces patterns that improve future judgment.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
- Outcome tracking on decisions (what happened vs what we expected)
- Pattern recognition across assumption validations/invalidations
- Strategy success/failure post-mortems with causal analysis
- "Here's what we learned" periodic synthesis reports
- Recommendation quality improvement based on historical accuracy

WHY IT MATTERS: This is what makes the flywheel claim real. Without it, Stratafy accumulates data but doesn't demonstrably get smarter. With it, the cold-start moat deepens — the system's judgment improves with every cycle.

DEPENDS ON: Decision Log, Assumptions, Insights, and Alignment Scan all being active with sufficient data (3-6 months minimum).

STATUS: Future — requires meaningful customer usage data before building.

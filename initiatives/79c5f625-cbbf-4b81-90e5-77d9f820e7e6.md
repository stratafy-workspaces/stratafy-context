# Decision Log Feature

## Description
Capture organizational decisions with context, rationale, and outcomes. Creates institutional memory that compounds and enables AI to reference past decisions.

From Decision Velocity blog: Decision Velocity = Context Availability x Decision Authority x Reversibility Awareness. The Decision Log is where context meets action.

LAYER: Cortex (the intelligence/analysis enabler - alongside alignment, external data services)

Rationale: Decisions are cross-cutting intelligence about the decision-making process, not strategy artifacts. They reference Foundation, Strategy, AND Initiatives. The AI research features (4-Question Filter, context pulling, similar decisions) are clearly Cortex-domain.

CORE FEATURES:
- Log decisions with Type 1/Type 2 classification
- Decision authority and deadline (time-boxing)
- Link to strategy/initiative
- Record rationale when decided
- Record outcomes later for learning loop

AI RESEARCH (later):
- Pull strategic context automatically
- Run 4-Question Filter
- Reference past similar decisions
- Structured analysis with recommendation

PHASES:

Phase 1 (Now - Jan/Feb 2026): Infrastructure & Dogfooding
- DB schema in cortex layer
- Effect-based services following existing cortex patterns
- MCP tools (create, list, get, update decisions)
- Enables immediate usage via Claude Desktop/Claude Code
- Validates behavior through real usage before UI investment

Phase 2 (Q2): API & Basic UI
- REST API endpoints
- Basic UI pages for create/list/view
- Build only after Phase 1 validates the model

Phase 3 (Q2-Q3): AI Research Integration
- Pull strategic context automatically
- Run 4-Question Filter on decisions
- Reference past similar decisions
- Structured analysis with recommendation

Phase 4 (Q3): Outcomes & Metrics
- Outcome tracking and learning loop
- Decision velocity metrics
- Dashboard visualization

VALIDATION APPROACH:
Dogfood via MCP first. Build UI when the model is proven. Every decision logged is flywheel data.

# STIR Collective: First Customer Engagement

## Description
First paying customer engagement. STIR Collective is a Joburg-based consolidated group of event companies (SGP Group, Virtual Productions, Lucid Sets, Immix Studios, and others). R25,000/month retainer covering Stratafy platform access, strategy building, and team training. Their need: build a coherent strategy across subsidiaries and produce a fundraising prospectus. Leonard is a small shareholder in STIR, which provides deep access and genuine commitment from leadership. This engagement is the critical learning vehicle for product-market fit — every friction point, adoption pattern, and value moment informs the Sequoia pitch and product roadmap.

## Engagement Scope

**Customer**: STIR Collective (stircollective.co.za)
**Retainer**: R25,000/month
**Start**: Week of Feb 17, 2026
**Deliverables**: Strategy development + fundraising prospectus + team training

## Technology Stack

**Stratafy** — Strategic layer (foundation, strategy tree, alignment, insights, decisions)
**Linear** — Operational layer (projects, tasks, sprints, execution tracking)
**Claude + MCP** — AI layer connecting both (query strategy, manage tasks, bridge intent and execution)

This is the AI Operations Stack thesis in production:

| Layer | Tool | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| Strategic Context | Stratafy | Source of truth for who we are, where we're going |
| Coordination | Linear | Task management, project tracking, execution |
| AI Interface | Claude + MCP | Connects strategy to execution conversationally |
| Human Decision | STIR Leadership | Approves, decides, directs |

## Why This Matters

This is not just a customer — it's the validation engine for everything:
1. First revenue (proves willingness to pay)
2. First real-world product usage (surfaces product gaps)
3. First case study (Sequoia pitch material)
4. First team training (tests multi-user adoption)
5. First fundraising prospectus output (proves output quality)
6. **First full-stack deployment** (Stratafy + Linear + Claude MCP = the thesis running live)

## Key Learning Objectives

- How long does onboarding take for a real company?
- What's the time-to-value? When do they say "this is useful"?
- Which features get used? Which get ignored?
- Where does the product break or confuse?
- Can their team use Stratafy independently after training?
- Does the fundraising prospectus output feel credible and compelling?
- **How naturally does the Stratafy-Linear-Claude workflow feel?**
- **Do users stay in Claude or switch between tools?**
- **What queries bridge strategy and execution?**

## Engagement Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Week 1-2)

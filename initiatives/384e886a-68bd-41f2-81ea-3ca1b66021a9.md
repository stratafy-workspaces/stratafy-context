# Radar MVP - Infrastructure & MCP

## Description
Build the foundation for Stratafy Radar — external intelligence filtered through strategic context. Following the Decision Log pattern: DB + Services + MCP first, then dogfood via Claude before building UI.

**TECHNICAL PLAN:** `.stratafy/technical-plans/radar-mvp-infrastructure-mcp.md`

**KEY REVISION:** This is an enhancement to existing Radar infrastructure, not a greenfield build. The existing `layers/radar/` layer provides sessions, prompts, and executions. This initiative adds structured output (findings, implications, recommendations) and MCP tools for Claude integration.

**NEW TABLES:**
- `radar_findings` — individual signals extracted from scans, auto-creates linked Insight
- `radar_implications` — contextualized implications linked to strategies
- `radar_recommendations` — actionable recommendations with decision/initiative links

**MCP TOOLS:**
- Query: `list_radar_scans`, `get_radar_scan`, `list_radar_findings`, `get_radar_finding`
- Mutation: `create_radar_scan`, `add_radar_finding`, `add_radar_implication`, `add_radar_recommendation`

**PHASES:**
1. Database & Types (Days 1-3)
2. Services with Effect patterns (Days 4-8)
3. MCP Tools (Days 9-14)
4. Dogfooding (Days 15-28)

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Can create and retrieve radar scans via MCP
- Findings auto-create insights with `source: 'stratafy_radar'`
- Can link implications to strategies via MCP
- Dogfooding for 2+ weeks before UI investment

# Radar MVP - Infrastructure & MCP

## Purpose

Build the foundation for Stratafy Radar — external intelligence filtered through strategic context. Following the Decision Log pattern: DB + Services + MCP first, then dogfood via Claude before building UI.

## Why This Approach

- Proven pattern from Decision Log (MCP-first, UI later)
- Enables immediate dogfooding via Claude Desktop/Claude Code
- Reduces manual work — enter scan results via MCP tools instead of raw DB
- Validates the data model through real usage before UI investment

## Architecture Decision: Hybrid Model (Option C)

Radar findings flow into the existing Insights system:

- Radar scan is a session that produces structured findings
- Each finding can create a linked Insight (source: 'stratafy_radar')
- Insights system provides the unified view of all learnings
- Radar provides the grouped, structured scan view with implications/recommendations

```
radar_scans (the scanning session)
  └── radar_findings (raw external signals)
        ├── radar_implications (what it means for YOUR strategy, links to strategies)
        ├── radar_recommendations (actionable next steps)
        └── → creates Insight (source: 'stratafy_radar', source_url: scan link)
```

**Benefits:**
- Radar keeps its rich structure (scans, findings, implications, recommendations)
- Insights get populated automatically from radar
- Learning loop sees everything in one place
- Can query "all insights" and radar findings appear
- Can query "radar scans" and see grouped, structured view

## Scope - Phase 1

### 1. Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `radar_scans` | Scan metadata (workspace, title, date, source, status) |
| `radar_findings` | Individual signals from a scan |
| `radar_implications` | Contextualized implications linked to strategies |
| `radar_recommendations` | Actionable recommendations |

Plus link to existing `insights` table via source field.

### 2. Effect-based Services

- Following existing Cortex layer patterns
- CRUD operations for scans, findings, implications, recommendations
- Auto-create Insight when finding is added (source: 'stratafy_radar')
- Link implications to strategies

### 3. MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `create_radar_scan` | Start a new scan |
| `add_radar_finding` | Add finding to scan (auto-creates linked Insight) |
| `add_radar_implication` | Add implication linked to strategy |
| `add_radar_recommendation` | Add recommendation to finding |
| `list_radar_scans` | Retrieve past scans |
| `get_radar_scan` | Get full scan with findings/implications/recommendations |

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- UI pages (Phase 2)
- Automated scanning/crawling
- Scheduled scans
- Alerts and notifications
- Trend analysis over time

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can create and retrieve radar scans via MCP
- [ ] Findings auto-create linked Insights
- [ ] Can link implications to strategies via MCP
- [ ] Can enter today's AI landscape scan via Claude
- [ ] Dogfooding for 2+ weeks before UI investment

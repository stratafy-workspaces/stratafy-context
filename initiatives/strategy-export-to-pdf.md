# Strategy Export to PDF

## Description
Build a tool that pulls the full workspace strategy (via get_workspace_snapshot) and exports it as a well-formed PDF document. Multiple output formats: strategy-on-a-page (one-pager for clients), comprehensive strategic operating document (board pack style), and alignment report (scored, with gaps and recommendations). Core value prop for advisory firms — generate professional strategy documents from live workspace data. Could be MCP tool, API endpoint, or UI feature.

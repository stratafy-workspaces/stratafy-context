# [FUTURE] Cultural & Values Coherence Sensing

## Description
Detect whether lived organizational behavior actually reflects stated values and principles. The hardest sensing problem — but where the real rot happens.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
- Decision pattern analysis: do logged decisions align with stated values?
- Consistency detection: flag when decision rationale contradicts principles
- Communication tone analysis: does how we talk match who we say we are?
- Hiring pattern analysis: are we hiring for the capabilities our values demand?
- Values drift alerting: "you say you value transparency but your last 5 decisions had no documented rationale"

SIGNAL SOURCES:
- Decision Log patterns (rationale vs values)
- Insight themes (what keeps surfacing vs what values prioritize)
- Radar findings response (do we act on what aligns with values or ignore it?)
- Organigram data (does structure reflect stated principles?)
- Execution session data (where does time actually go vs stated priorities?)

WHY IT MATTERS: Foundation layer currently feels aspirational — values on a wall. This makes it alive. When the system can say "your values say X but your behavior shows Y," that's when foundation becomes infrastructure, not decoration. Directly validates a core Stratafy belief.

ADVISORY FIRM VALUE: Culture assessments are a premium service. Automating the sensing turns it from a one-off engagement into continuous monitoring.

STATUS: Future — depends on sufficient behavioral data across decisions, insights, and execution sessions. Hardest to build, potentially highest value.

ARCHITECTURE: Cortex layer. Cross-references foundation elements against behavioral data from decisions, insights, execution sessions, and organigram.

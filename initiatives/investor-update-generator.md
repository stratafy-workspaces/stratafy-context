# Investor Update Generator

## Description
Auto-generate investor update documents from live workspace data. Pulls metrics (current vs target, period-over-period movement), key decisions made, risk register changes, assumption validations/invalidations, initiative progress, and content milestones. Structured as: highlights, metrics dashboard, key decisions, risks and mitigations, what's next. Founder adds narrative layer on top. Reduces monthly investor update from hours to minutes. Also serves as forcing function to keep workspace current. Strong proof point for Sequoia — dogfooding the product for investor relations.

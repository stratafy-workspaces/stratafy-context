## Content
Currently the insight-to-strategy feedback loop is manual — run via Claude chat. For this to be a real product feature it needs: (1) Automated triggers — threshold-based (5+ pending insights), time-based (weekly review), event-based (milestone completed). (2) Templated analysis prompts — stored, versioned, customizable per workspace. (3) One-click execution — Run Strategic Review button, shows recommendations, approve/modify/reject flow, applies changes automatically. (4) Review history — log of all reviews, what changed and why, audit trail for governance. This is the Alignment Scan equivalent for insights-to-strategy, not just foundation-to-strategy.

# Workspace Hierarchy (Parent/Child)

## Description
Introduce parent/child workspace hierarchy to support aggregator use cases (VC firms, advisory firms). Parent workspaces can query across child workspaces for portfolio-level insights, alignment scores, and strategic health.

## Why This Matters

The VC and advisory firm GTM channels both depend on a single capability: querying across multiple company workspaces from a parent view. Without hierarchy, every workspace is an island.

## Use Cases

**VC Partner**: "Which portfolio companies have the highest strategic drift?" → Queries alignment scores across 20+ child workspaces

**Advisory Firm**: "Which clients need attention this quarter?" → Aggregates health metrics across client workspaces

**Portfolio CEO**: Full access to own workspace, no visibility into siblings

## Architecture Requirements

- Parent/child workspace relationships
- Cross-workspace querying with permission scoping
- Aggregated views (alignment scores, risk distribution, initiative progress)
- Role-based access: parent sees aggregated child data, children can't see siblings
- MCP tools for cross-workspace queries

## Sequencing

**Not needed for**: ScaleUp demo (Feb 16) — they're a direct user first
**Needed before**: Sequoia demo (April) — portfolio visibility is the pitch
**Full build**: Post-seed (Q2 2026)

## Dependencies

- Workspace stats via MCP (enhancement logged)
- Permission model for cross-workspace access
- Aggregation layer for alignment scores across workspaces

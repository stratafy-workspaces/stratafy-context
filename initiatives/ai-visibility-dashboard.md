# AI Visibility Dashboard

## Description
Surface existing MCP activity logs into a customer-facing dashboard. Shows what humans and AI agents are doing with strategic context—who accessed what, when, and what operations they performed. Must be functional before STIR kickoff (Feb 17) to demonstrate visibility value from day one.

THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING:
Organizations have no visibility into what AI is doing in their name.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
We already log this data via MCP. Every tool call captures: user, operation, timestamp, duration, status, client, session. The instrumentation exists—we just need to surface it.

MVP SCOPE: Dashboard UI on existing log data with filter, success/error rates, session timeline, basic analytics.

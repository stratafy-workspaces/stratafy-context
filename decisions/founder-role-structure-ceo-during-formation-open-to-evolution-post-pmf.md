# Founder Role Structure: CEO During Formation, Open to Evolution Post-PMF

## Description
Define the founder role structure for Stratafy, specifically the relationship between CEO responsibilities, technical involvement, and co-founder dynamics. This decision shapes co-founder recruiting, investor positioning, and personal time allocation.

## Details
- **Type**: Type 1 (Irreversible)
- **Status**: decided
- **Authority**: Founder
- **Deadline**: No deadline
- **Decided At**: 2026-01-30T13:07:01.247+00:00

## Context
Current state (Jan 30, 2026): Solo founder, pre-seed, actively seeking technical co-founder. Ignatius is primary candidate but decision not dependent on him specifically. Product in active development with Feb 10 MVP deadline. Investor conversations planned for April 2026 (Sequoia path via Pieter).

Troop history: Leonard was technical founder, gradually excluded from strategic decisions as he got busy building. Pattern recognition driving this decision.

Co-founder search criteria now clarified: Looking for technical co-founder who wants to build, comfortable with Leonard as external face and strategic decision-maker, doesn't need boardroom spotlight, gets energy from engineering excellence.

Phase definition:
- Formation (now → PMF): Leonard is CEO, non-negotiable
- Early Scale (PMF → operational): Leonard is CEO, evaluating
- Operational Scale: CEO question reopens based on company needs

## Decision
Leonard is CEO during the formation phase (now through PMF and early scaling). This is non-negotiable until the company operationalizes. Technical co-founder is a strategic partner with real input, but final decisions flow through CEO. Leonard stays technical — a CEO who codes, not a CEO who delegates product. Investor relations, board relationships, and strategic decisions are owned by Leonard visibly and consistently. Post-PMF, as company operationalizes, the CEO question reopens — bringing in an operational CEO is explicitly on the table, decided based on future context and company needs.

PERSONAL OPERATING COMMITMENT:

Strategic presence is not optional. The technical co-founder role exists to handle engineering load so I can stay in every investor conversation, board discussion, and key strategic decision. If I find myself "too busy" for strategic conversations, that's a red flag to address structurally — not a reason to delegate. This is the Troop pattern I will not repeat.

## Rationale
1. Lived experience at Troop: Technical founder role led to gradual exclusion from strategic decisions. Being "heads down building" while others filled the strategic vacuum resulted in losing strategic voice. This pattern must not repeat.

2. Formation phase requires founder judgment: During product formation, the person with the vision needs decision authority. Strategy and product are inseparable at this stage. Delegating strategic leadership now would dilute the vision.

3. Technical depth is an asset, not a limitation: Best technical CEOs (Musk, Collison, Saarinen) stay close to product. The goal is CEO who codes, not pure delegation.

4. Co-founder relationship clarity: Defining this upfront prevents ambiguity. Technical co-founder knows the structure: strategic partner with input, not co-equal decision maker. Right co-founder will value this clarity.

5. Openness to evolution: This isn't ego protection — it's phase-appropriate leadership. When company operationalizes and needs different skills, bringing in operational CEO is legitimate. But that's a future decision with future information.

6. Investor positioning: Founder-market fit story includes technical depth AND strategic ownership. Not "technical founder looking for business co-founder" — but "technical CEO building category-defining company."

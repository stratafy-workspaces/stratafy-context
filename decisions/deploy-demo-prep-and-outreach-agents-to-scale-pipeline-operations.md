# Deploy Demo Prep and Outreach agents to scale pipeline operations

## Description
Deploy Stratafy's own agent infrastructure to automate demo preparation and prospect outreach. This serves three strategic purposes: (1) unblocks pipeline bottleneck — 3hrs manual prep per prospect doesn't scale for a solo founder, (2) dogfoods the agent registry and context packaging with real operational load, (3) creates a compelling founder story for investors and customers: "we used our own product's agents to build our sales pipeline."

## Decision
Create Demo Prep Agent as first priority — automates company research, workspace creation, foundation/strategy population, alignment scan, and radar scan. Follow with Outreach Drafter Agent. Both operate as assisted agents with human approval on all external actions. Track under AI Leverage & Automation strategy, linked to Pipeline Diversification Sprint initiative.

## Rationale
Pipeline sprint targets 3+ demo workspaces by Feb 28. Manual prep is 3 hours per prospect. With 8-10 prospects to qualify, that's 24-30 hours of prep for a solo founder who also needs to code, write content, and do demos. AI agents reduce this to review-and-approve. The story matters as much as the efficiency: Stratafy agents running Stratafy operations is the thesis in action.

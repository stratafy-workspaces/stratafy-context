# One interface with role-aware modes, not 7 separate interfaces

## Description
Build one Strategic Advisor interface with role-aware modes instead of 7 separate interfaces. Same prompt architecture, different context flags. Reduces near-term complexity while preserving the architecture vision.

## Details
- **Type**: Type 2 (Reversible)
- **Status**: decided
- **Authority**: Not specified
- **Deadline**: No deadline

## Context
No context recorded

## Research
No research recorded

## Decision
Build one Advisor interface with role-aware modes. The system detects or is told the user's role and adapts tone, access, agency, and capture accordingly.

## Rationale
7 separate interfaces creates complexity creep risk. One interface with modes ships faster, maintains architecture vision, and the prospect feels like they're using the real product. AI leverage makes modes feasible without massive engineering.

## Outcome

# Feb 10 MVP Sprint Scope

## Description
Define the scope for the Feb 10 MVP sprint. Three deliverables identified: Alignment Scan MVP, Context Packaging Engine, AI Visibility Dashboard. Need to confirm scope, trade-offs, and what's explicitly out of scope for this sprint.

## Details
- **Type**: Type 2 (Reversible)
- **Status**: decided
- **Authority**: Not specified
- **Deadline**: 2026-02-10T00:00:00+00:00
- **Decided At**: 2026-02-08T21:52:49.489+00:00

## Context
No context recorded

## Research
No research recorded

## Decision
Alignment Scan MVP is the critical deliverable. Context Packaging Engine and AI Visibility Dashboard are secondary — nice to have for demo but not blockers. Priority: (1) Alignment Scan functional on at least one strategy, (2) MCP workspace cleanup and metrics population, (3) Demo prep for ScaleUp. The Feb 10 deadline slipped — realistic completion is Feb 15 given travel.

## Rationale
Feb 10 deadline passed during travel/Dakar recovery period. ScaleUp demo pushed to week of Feb 17 due to Cape Town arrival on Feb 16. Extra days allow focused completion of Alignment Scan without rushing. Context Packaging and Dashboard deferred — the demo doesn't need them to be compelling.

## Outcome
No outcome recorded yet

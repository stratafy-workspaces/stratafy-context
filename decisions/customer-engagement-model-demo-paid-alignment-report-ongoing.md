## Decision
Four-stage engagement model: (1) Free demo — onboarding conversation on pre-populated workspace, customer experiences the platform on their own context. (2) Paid strategy alignment — take their actual strategy document, properly align the workspace, run alignment scans, surface gaps, identify missing assumptions and risks. Charge for time. (3) Report and discussion — deliver strategic health assessment with findings, discuss how to act on gaps. (4) Ongoing engagement — weekly radar scans, continuous alignment monitoring, subscription model. This sequence generates early revenue through genuine strategic value while deepening workspace lock-in at each stage.

## Rationale
Solves three problems simultaneously: (1) Early-stage revenue — not giving the product away hoping for conversion, charging for real strategic analysis. (2) Lock-in deepening — each paid engagement adds more data to the workspace, increasing switching cost. (3) Channel modelling — this is exactly the workflow advisory firms like ScaleUp would run with their own clients, so we're demonstrating the resale motion by doing it ourselves.

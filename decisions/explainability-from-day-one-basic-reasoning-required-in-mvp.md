# Explainability from Day One — basic reasoning required in MVP

## Description
Alignment scan identified that delaying explainability to Phase 4 violates the core principle 'Explainability is non-negotiable.' Decided to require basic reasoning from day one.

## Details
- **Type**: Type 1 (Irreversible)
- **Status**: decided
- **Authority**: Not specified
- **Deadline**: No deadline
- **Decided At**: 2026-02-06T13:18:36.15+00:00

## Context
No context recorded

## Research
No research recorded

## Decision
Basic AI reasoning (why did AI recommend this?) must be visible from Phase 1 MVP. Full explainability (confidence intervals, counterfactuals) can wait for Phase 4.

## Rationale
Violates core principle if deferred entirely. Basic reasoning builds trust from first interaction. Full explainability can be phased but the foundation must be present at MVP.

## Outcome
No outcome recorded yet

# Diversify lighthouse pipeline beyond Pieter and Nicholas

## Description
Current pipeline has only two lighthouse prospects (Nicholas at ScaleUp, Pieter at Clickatell), neither of whom has confirmed follow-up sessions. Dependency on two people for product validation and investor narrative is a strategic risk. Decision to actively broaden the prospect pipeline during the Cape Town return, targeting founders/execs who've scaled past 30-50 people and felt alignment break down, plus advisory firms who see the problem across clients.

## Context
No context recorded

## Research
No research recorded

## Decision
Actively diversify lighthouse pipeline starting immediately — use the drive back to Cape Town for outreach planning, leverage LinkedIn/X posts for inbound, reactivate existing Attio leads (African Green Alpha, Viridis AFC), and identify 5-10 new prospects before end of February.

## Rationale
Two prospects isn't a pipeline, it's a dependency. Neither has confirmed follow-ups. The April pitch window requires validated proof points from real customers, not just self-dogfooding. Broadening now protects against any single "no" derailing the fundraise narrative.

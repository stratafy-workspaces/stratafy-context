# Lighthouse customers don't materialize before pitch window

## Description
ScaleUp Company and Pieter/Clickatell don't convert to active users before April 2026 pitch window. Without lighthouse customers, the seed raise lacks proof points: no case studies, no usage data, no external validation. Investor pitch relies entirely on vision and dogfooding evidence rather than market pull.

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: medium
- **Impact**: high
- **Risk Score**: 6
- **Type**: market
- **Source**: external
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Accelerate ScaleUp engagement post-Feb 16 meeting. Prepare fallback lighthouse candidates from network. Strengthen dogfooding narrative as primary proof point. Build Stratafy-on-Stratafy case study with quantified metrics as backup. Ensure Alignment Scan MVP is demo-ready by Feb 10 to maximize conversion chance.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

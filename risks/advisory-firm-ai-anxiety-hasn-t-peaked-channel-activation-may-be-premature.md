# Advisory firm AI anxiety hasn't peaked — channel activation may be premature

## Description
The advisory firm channel assumes firms are feeling AI disruption anxiety now and would adopt Stratafy as a hedge. But advisory firms may not yet feel the threat acutely enough to act — they're still billing well, clients aren't replacing them with AI yet, and the "AI will eat consulting" narrative may be 12-24 months ahead of buyer readiness. If advisory firms see Stratafy as a nice-to-have rather than urgent, the channel activation timeline extends past the pitch window.

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: medium
- **Impact**: medium
- **Risk Score**: 4
- **Type**: market
- **Source**: external
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Validate urgency level in ScaleUp Company conversations — are they feeling AI pressure now or is it theoretical? Lead with growth value prop (continuous client visibility, revenue share) rather than AI hedge if urgency is low. Prepare to pivot primary GTM to direct-to-CEO if advisory channel is slower than expected. Use Pieter/Clickatell as the faster validation path for direct CEO use case.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

# AI-enhanced incumbent tools add 'good enough' strategy context features

## Description
AI-enhanced OKR and strategy tools (Lattice, 15Five, Viva Goals, potentially Notion or Monday.com) could add 'strategy context' features that address some of Stratafy's value proposition. They'd be bolting strategy onto execution tracking rather than building from foundation up, but 'good enough' features from an already-adopted tool could stall Stratafy adoption. The 18-24 month category creation window is the buffer — but incumbents with existing user bases move faster on feature additions than startups move on market capture.

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: medium
- **Impact**: high
- **Risk Score**: 6
- **Type**: competitive
- **Source**: external
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Differentiate through first-principles depth (foundation → strategy → intelligence layers). Build methodology-specific onboarding (auto-import OPSP, V/TO) that incumbents can't replicate without restructuring their data model. Establish advisory firm partnerships that create distribution lock-in. Move fast on category creation content to own the narrative before incumbents respond.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

# Incumbent ships "good enough" AI strategy features

## Description
Notion (AI-powered workspace), Linear (already has AI features), Atlassian (Rovo AI), or Microsoft (Copilot + Viva) could ship "AI strategy alignment" or "strategic context for AI agents" features. They have distribution, existing user bases, and engineering teams. Even a mediocre incumbent feature could slow Stratafy's category creation by muddying the narrative. The risk is not that they build something better — it's that they build something "good enough" that removes urgency from the buyer.

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: medium
- **Impact**: high
- **Risk Score**: 6
- **Type**: competitive
- **Source**: external
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Monitor incumbent product announcements weekly via Radar. Accelerate category definition through content and thought leadership (already ahead here). Deepen the moat through flywheel data and operational lock-in that incumbents can't replicate quickly. Position on depth of strategic intelligence, not surface features. The AI Operations Stack methodology is defensible IP that tools alone can't replicate.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

# No revenue model or pricing strategy defined

## Description
No pricing strategy, revenue model, or monetization plan is visible anywhere in the strategy tree. The GTM strategies describe channels and value propositions but not how money flows. Advisory firm "revenue share" is mentioned but not defined. Without a tested pricing model before the pitch window, investors will probe this gap. More critically, without pricing clarity, lighthouse customer conversations lack commercial framing — are they free pilots forever? When does paid conversion happen? What's the ACV target?

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: high
- **Impact**: high
- **Risk Score**: 9
- **Type**: financial
- **Source**: internal
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Define preliminary pricing tiers before lighthouse customer conversations progress beyond pilot. Research comparable SaaS pricing (strategy tools, AI governance platforms). Test willingness-to-pay with ScaleUp during pilot. Have at least a working pricing hypothesis ready for the April pitch — investors expect this even at seed stage.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

# Solo founder bottleneck / co-founder doesn't join

## Description
Everything currently depends on Leonard. If Ignatius doesn't convert as technical co-founder by April 2026, the company faces: reduced credibility with investors (solo non-technical founder), execution ceiling on product development, single point of failure for all operations, and burnout risk from sustained overload. The AI agent leverage helps but doesn't fully mitigate the need for a co-founder.

## Assessment
- **Likelihood**: medium
- **Impact**: critical
- **Risk Score**: 8
- **Type**: people
- **Source**: internal
- **Status**: active

## Mitigation
- **Status**: identified
- **Plan**: Primary path: Ignatius conversion with clear decision deadline. Fallback: broader co-founder search if primary closes. Interim: maximize AI agent leverage to demonstrate solo founder can execute. Frame AI-augmented solo founder as strength, not weakness, for investor narrative.
- **Review Date**: Not scheduled

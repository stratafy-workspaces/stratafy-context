# Core Values

## Problem education over Solution promotion

Trust comes from helping people understand, not selling. Explaining the AI execution gap clearly attracts the right customers.

## Continuous alignment over Periodic review

The world moves too fast for quarterly cycles. AI agents act continuously; strategy must be accessible continuously.

## First principles over Best practices

Frameworks expire; fundamentals endure. We rebuilt strategy from atomic elements rather than copying existing tools.

## Infrastructure mindset over Application mindset

We're building the layer everything else depends on. This requires different design choices than point solutions.

## Clarity over Complexity

If it can't be understood, it can't be executed. We prefer simple models that work over complex ones that impress.

## Earned trust over Assumed authority

We prove value before asking for commitment. Free pilots, documented outcomes, then paid conversion.

## Human primacy over Pure automation

AI amplifies human judgment; it doesn't replace it. AI suggests, humans approve. Always.

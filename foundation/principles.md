# Operating Principles

## Move fast with visible reasoning

We move fast with visible reasoning. Every decision connects to strategy. Every change is traceable. Speed without explanation feels like chaos to teams. Speed with visible logic builds trust and enables even more speed. When we change direction, we show why. When we prioritize, we show the trade-off. The goal isn't to slow down for alignment — it's to make alignment so fast that velocity is never compromised. "Move fast and break things" becomes "Move fast and show your work."

## Foundation before strategy, strategy before tactics

You can't align what isn't defined. The product enforces this sequence: define identity first, then strategic choices, then tactical execution. Skipping steps creates the coherence problems we're trying to solve.

## Strategy flows both directions

Top-down: Intent guides execution. Bottom-up: Execution informs strategy. The feedback loop is not a feature—it's the core of the system. Strategy that only flows down is strategy that loses touch with reality. With role-aware interfaces, the sensing surface area multiplies exponentially. Every role captures different signals: founder captures strategic decisions, board captures governance patterns, investors capture market intel, managers capture execution friction, ICs capture ground-level reality, prospects capture buying signals. The whole organization becomes a learning system. Currently Stratafy's feedback loop is founder-only. The vision is organization-wide sensing that feeds continuous strategic improvement.

## Explainability is non-negotiable

AI must show its reasoning against strategic intent. "I recommended X because it aligns with principle Y and advances objective Z" is the minimum. Unexplainable AI recommendations are rejected, not surfaced.

## Strategy is the coordination layer

In multi-agent systems, shared context prevents conflict. When multiple AI agents need to cooperate, strategy provides the shared understanding. This is how we prevent the sales agent and support agent from making incompatible promises.

## Abstract must translate to operational

"Be customer-centric" means nothing alone. The product forces translation: what does customer-centric mean for pricing decisions? For feature prioritization? For support response times? Principles without operational definitions are decoration.

## Time horizons require explicit tradeoffs

AI optimizes short-term by default. Long-term constraints must be encoded explicitly. The product surfaces when short-term recommendations conflict with long-term strategy and forces conscious tradeoffs.

## Uncertainty requires humility

AI should know what it doesn't know. Confidence thresholds gate autonomous action. When strategic context is missing or ambiguous, the system escalates to human judgment rather than guessing.

## Sensing over reporting

Continuous awareness beats periodic review. Radar (external) and Pulse (internal) monitor reality continuously. Reports are artifacts of sensing, not substitutes for it.

## Consumable in real-time

Strategy must be API-accessible. AI agents query strategy continuously, not on a schedule. There is no human bottleneck for strategic context—the system serves context at machine speed.

## Eat our own dog food

Stratafy uses Stratafy. This document is part of our Foundation layer. Our roadmap lives in our Strategy layer. Our metrics are tracked in our Tactics layer. We use AI throughout our workflows—modeling the human-AI collaboration we enable for customers. If our product can't run our company, it can't run anyone's.

## Show, don't tell

Demonstrate value before claiming it. Content educates; the product proves. Customers should feel the difference between working with strategy infrastructure and without it. If we have to argue for the value, we haven't shown it clearly enough.

## Speed with intention

The category-creation window rewards velocity. But we never sacrifice clarity for speed. Right beats fast, though we pursue both when possible. A clear feature shipped next week beats a confusing one shipped today.

## Minimize organizational compile time

Treat organizational cycle time like code compilation — minimize it relentlessly. Tesla reduces "compile time" from idea to production to 3 hours for wiring updates. Hardware cycles went from 5-7 years (traditional) to under 30 days. The metaphor works because engineers intuitively understand: long compile times kill productivity. Applied to strategy: the gap between insight and action should be minutes, not months. Quarterly reviews are like compiling once per quarter — unacceptable in a fast-moving environment.

## One system, many interfaces

Different roles need different interactions with the same strategic context. CEO needs an advisor that challenges and has full agency. Board needs an interface that's transparent and concise. Investor needs honest status and risk awareness. Prospect needs a demo that proves value through their own data. Manager needs a coach that translates strategy to team context. IC needs a guide that connects their work to meaning. Same underlying system — foundation, strategies, insights, feedback loop. Different presentation, tone, access, and agency. The user shouldn't have to adapt to us; we adapt to them. This is how strategy becomes accessible to everyone, not just executives who speak strategy-fluently.

## The demo is the product

The best demo uses the prospect's own context — their strategy, their misalignments, their foundation. Don't pitch; prove. Pre-populate their workspace with what we know (mission from website, values from culture page, strategies from public info or discovery call). Run alignment scans on THEIR data. Surface THEIR gaps. By the end of a demo, value is experienced, not promised. The objection "I need to see if it works for us" disappears when they've already seen it on their own strategy. The demo IS the product. The conversation IS the value. By the time they decide, they've already used Stratafy. Sell through doing, not telling.

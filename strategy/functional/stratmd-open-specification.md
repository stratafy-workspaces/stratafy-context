# StratMD Open Specification

## Description
Position StratMD as the open standard for markdown-native strategy documentation. Builds intellectual moat, developer adoption, and ecosystem lock-in.

**THE THESIS (Resilient Memory):**

Three insights converged into a unified competitive position:

1. **Handoff Preservation** — The handoff problem (agent-to-agent, now-to-future) is fundamentally a strategy preservation problem. Context decay erodes intent.

2. **Negative Knowledge** — What you rejected matters as much as what you did. The Decision Graveyard captures antibody memory—rejected approaches that prevent loops.

3. **Integrity Under Adversarial Pressure** — Strategic memory isn't just for continuity; it's for integrity. An agent that loads constraints before context can resist being reshaped by adversarial inputs.

**UNIFIED FRAME:**
StratMD isn't just memory. It's RESILIENT MEMORY—strategic context that persists AND actively defends its own coherence.

**POSITIONING:**
"The tool that doesn't just help agents execute strategy—it helps them stay themselves while executing."

**COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION:**
This positions StratMD in AI security conversations, not just productivity/memory tooling:

| Frame | Competitors | StratMD Position |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Memory/RAG | Mem0, LangChain | Commodity |
| Agent frameworks | CrewAI, AutoGen | Crowded |
| Identity preservation under adversarial pressure | Almost nobody | Differentiated |

**WHY OPEN SPEC:**
- Establishes thought leadership (we define the standard)
- Creates ecosystem lock-in (implementations reference our spec)
- Generates developer adoption (GitHub → credibility → enterprise)
- StratClaw demonstrates the thesis publicly

**KEY DELIVERABLES:**
- StratMD spec v0.2 (Decision Graveyard, Security Considerations, Required Constraints)
- stratmd.org content and community
- StratClaw as living proof
- Developer adoption metrics

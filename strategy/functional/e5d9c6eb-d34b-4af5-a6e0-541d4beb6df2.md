# VC as Customer Segment

## Description
Target VCs as a primary customer segment, not just funding sources. VCs represent an ideal GTM channel: one sale deploys Stratafy to 20+ portfolio companies.

**The Value Proposition to VCs:**
1. Portfolio Value Creation — deploy strategic infrastructure to portfolio companies as differentiated value-add
2. Portfolio Visibility — real-time dashboard of strategic health across all companies
3. Portfolio Engagement — MCP access to query across portfolio, engage with company strategic agents
4. Deal Evaluation — assess potential investments through strategic coherence lens
5. LP Reporting — aggregate portfolio metrics for evidence-based updates

**GTM Motion:**
- Land with VC firm → they deploy to portfolio companies
- VC becomes distribution channel (one sale = many deployments)
- Network effects as portfolio companies talk and Stratafy becomes standard
- Social proof: "Sequoia uses Stratafy" validates for entire market

**Architecture Fit:**
- VC Partner = Strategic Interface (portfolio-wide view)
- Portfolio CEO = Strategic Advisor (company-specific)
- Role-Aware Strategic Intelligence supports this natively

**Initial Targets:**
- Madrona (warm path via Ted Kummert, already experiencing AI context problems)
- Sequoia (existing strategy via Pieter/Roelof path)

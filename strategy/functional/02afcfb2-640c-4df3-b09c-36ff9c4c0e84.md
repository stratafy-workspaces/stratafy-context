# Madrona Engagement

## Description
Warm path to Madrona via existing relationship with Ted Kummert. Key advantage: Ted has already identified the exact problem Stratafy solves—Madrona is using Claude but struggling with context.

**The Opportunity:**
- Ted Kummert is a partner at Madrona, previously at UIPath
- Leonard has existing relationship from Troop days
- Ted mentioned to Ignatius that context for AI tools is an issue at Madrona
- This is a "pull" opportunity, not a cold pitch

**Timing:**
- Reach out after Context Packaging Engine ships (Feb 10)
- Pitch: "You mentioned context is an issue with Claude—I built something that solves this"
- Demo Stratafy with Madrona's own context, show portfolio view

**Dual Angle:**
- Madrona as customer (portfolio infrastructure)
- Madrona as investor (they understand the problem firsthand)

**Demo Approach:**
- Build Madrona workspace with their portfolio companies
- Show how Context Packaging Engine solves their stated pain
- Let Ted experience Strategic Advisor with real strategic context

**Relationship Path:**
Leonard → Ted (direct, existing relationship) → Madrona partners → Investment/customer decision

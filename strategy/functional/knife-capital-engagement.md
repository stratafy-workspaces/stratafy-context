# Knife Capital Engagement

## Description
Friendly VC validation via direct relationship with Keet van Zyl (GP). NOT a fundraising target — a product validation and perspective source.

THREE VALUE ANGLES:

1. VC-as-Customer Thesis Validation — Does the portfolio visibility value prop land with a real GP? Stress-test the pitch before Madrona and Sequoia.

2. SA Market Intelligence — Knife Capital invests in SA growth-stage companies. Keet sees advisory firm and scaling company pain points firsthand.

3. Reference Point Creation — If Keet gets excited, that's ammunition for Madrona/Sequoia: "Knife Capital's GP is exploring this for portfolio management."

FRAMING: Not "we're raising" but "I'm building something that solves a problem VCs have — I'd love your perspective." Show the portfolio view concept, ask what would make it useful for deal flow and portfolio monitoring.

TIMING: Before Pieter meeting in March. Low-stakes, high-learning. Can happen in parallel with STIR and ScaleUp.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Candid feedback on portfolio visibility value prop
- Identifies what would make him actually use it for Knife Capital
- Feedback incorporated into Madrona/Sequoia demo prep
- Bonus: Keet wants to pilot for his own portfolio

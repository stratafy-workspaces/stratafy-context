# Product Architecture

## Description
The 4+3 architecture blueprint—4 execution levels (Foundation, Strategy, Initiatives, Tactics) + 3 enablers (Cortex, Context, Tools). This defines WHAT we're building; Product-Market Fit validates WHO wants it and WHY.

# Product Development Strategy

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: How do we build the strategic operating system that delivers on our vision?

**Time Horizon**: 2026-2028+

**Strategic Theme**: Build the strategic operating system in phases—from MVP through full 4+3 platform—delivering value iteratively while maintaining architectural integrity for AI-native strategy execution.

## The 4+3 Architecture

Stratafy is built on **4 execution levels + 3 enablers**:

### Execution Levels

| Level | Question | What It Provides |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Who are we? | Mission, vision, values, principles, beliefs |
| **Strategy** | Where do we focus? | Strategic themes, positioning, capabilities |
| **Initiatives** | What do we commit to? | Resourced programs with budgets, teams, timelines |
| **Tactics** | How do we execute? | Objectives, plans, milestones, metrics |

### Enablers

| Enabler | Question | What It Provides |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Cortex** | How do we learn? | AI predictions, feedback loops, anomaly detection |
| **Context** | What informs us? | Documents, market data, embeddings (Radar + Pulse) |
| **Tools** | What supports us? | Integrations, agents, orchestration |

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **AI-Native from Day One**: Built for continuous AI agent consumption, not retrofitted
2. **API-First**: Strategy must be queryable, embeddable, programmatically accessible
3. **Modular by Design**: Each level/enabler can be adopted independently
4. **Bidirectional Flow**: Top-down intent guides execution; bottom-up execution informs strategy
5. **Human Primacy**: AI suggests, humans approve—always
6. **Explainability from Day One**: AI shows reasoning against strategic intent, even in Phase 1
7. **Value in First Session**: New users see alignment score and actionable gaps immediately

## Phased Rollout

### Phase 5: Ecosystem & Tools (Q2-Q4 2027)
- Tools layer (agent orchestration, integrations hub)
- Full Context (market data synthesis, embeddings)
- Network effects with privacy-preserved learnings
- **Success**: 100+ customers, $25M ARR

### Phase 6: Complete Vision (2028+)
- All four levels + three enablers fully deployed
- Enterprise adaptability, industry standards
- Open-sourcing of non-core elements
- **Success**: 500+ customers, $75M+ ARR

## Quick Win Experience (Phase 1 Requirement)

New users must see value in their first session. The default landing experience:

1. **Alignment Score**: Overall foundation-strategy coherence (1-10)
2. **Top 3 Gaps**: Specific misalignments or missing elements
3. **One Concrete Improvement**: AI-suggested change they can apply immediately
4. **Reasoning Visible**: Why the AI recommended each gap/improvement

This operationalizes "Earned trust over Assumed authority" and "Show, don't tell."

## Explainability Architecture

Explainability is non-negotiable from Phase 1, not Phase 4:

| Phase | Explainability Level |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Basic: AI shows which foundation elements inform each recommendation |
| **Phase 2** | Intermediate: Alignment score breakdown, gap attribution |
| **Phase 3** | Advanced: Drift detection reasoning, trend attribution |
| **Phase 4** | Full: Predictions with confidence intervals, counterfactual analysis |

**Principle**: Users should never wonder "why did the AI say that?" — even in MVP.

## 🐕 Dogfooding in Product (Phase 2)

"Stratafy's Strategy" becomes a built-in, explorable example:

- **Foundation**: Our actual mission, vision, values, beliefs, principles
- **Strategy**: Category Leadership and sub-strategies
- **Initiatives**: Current commitments with real progress
- **Tactics**: Objectives and metrics (appropriately filtered)

This turns "Eat our own dog food" from principle to visible trust signal. Customers see how we use our own tool.

## Ethical AI Architecture (Phase 4 Documentation)

Phase 4 Cortex includes explicit ethical components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bias Detection** | Flag recommendations that may reflect data bias |
| **Decision Audit Trail** | Complete history of AI recommendations and human decisions |
| **Confidence Thresholds** | AI explicitly states confidence; low-confidence triggers human review |
| **Human Escalation Triggers** | Automatic escalation for high-stakes strategic decisions |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Customer data never trains models without explicit consent |

This operationalizes the belief: "Ethical guardrails are inherent to AI-strategy alignment."

## The Continuous Feedback Loop

```
Sense → Analyze → Review → Decide → Adjust → Execute → Sense...
```

- **Radar**: External monitoring (market, competitors, regulations)
- **Pulse**: Internal health (progress, drift, blockers)
- **Cortex**: Intelligence that connects sensing to action

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains:

- We do NOT skip levels—Foundation before Strategy before Initiatives before Tactics
- We do NOT sacrifice architectural integrity for short-term features
- We do NOT build features that increase complexity without proportional clarity
- We do NOT retrofit AI—every component is AI-native from design
- We do NOT conflate strategies with initiatives (direction vs. commitment)
- We do NOT ship AI recommendations without visible reasoning (even in MVP)
- We do NOT delay value demonstration—first session must show actionable insights

## Success Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | Customers | ARR | Key Metric |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----|------------|
| 1 | Q1 2026 | 2-3 | $0 | 80% activation, value in first session |
| 2 | Q2 2026 | 5-10 | $100K | 20% alignment uplift |
| 3 | Q3 2026 | 10-20 | $1M | 30% drift reduction |
| 4 | Q4 2026-Q1 2027 | 50 | $5M | 90% success scores |
| 5 | 2027 | 100+ | $25M | Network effects |

| Human-only interfaces | Human + AI native |
| Annual planning cycles | Continuous sensing and adaptation |
| Disconnected from execution | Directly linked to outcomes |
| Strategy and initiatives conflated | Clear separation: direction vs. commitment |
| Black-box AI | Explainable AI from day one |
| Value after weeks of setup | Value in first session |

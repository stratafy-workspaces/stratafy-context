# Funding & Growth

## Description
Secure resources to scale beyond solo founder capacity. Convert early traction into institutional funding to accelerate category capture. Position with founder-market fit, timing fit (category window is now), technical fit (AI-native), and traction fit.

# Funding & Growth (S3)

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: Can we secure resources to scale beyond solo founder capacity?

**Time Horizon**: Q2 2026 - Q1 2027

**Strategic Theme**: Convert early traction into institutional funding to accelerate category capture.

## The Founding Story

**The short version:**

> "I ran a company using velocity culture and continuous alignment — manually. It worked but I couldn't prove it. I couldn't systematize it. And I couldn't get buy-in from a team that wanted traditional methods. Stratafy is the infrastructure I wish I had."

**The two problems at Troop:**

| Problem | What Happened | How Stratafy Solves It |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **No infrastructure** | Knowledge in heads, decisions seemed ad hoc, founder in every meeting | System makes alignment visible, queryable, shareable |
| **No buy-in** | Team wanted traditional methods, saw velocity as chaos | Product embodies the methodology — teams experience it through use, not argument |

**Key proof points:**

- 2024 Troop email documents the exact frustrations Stratafy solves — velocity culture without infrastructure, continuous alignment without visibility
- Same principles cited (Linear, Ramp, "velocity over everything") now codified in product
- Founder-market fit: lived the problem from both sides — the visionary who couldn't systematize, and the leader who couldn't get buy-in

**Why this resonates:**

You don't have to argue for the methodology anymore. The tool IS the methodology. When someone uses Stratafy and sees "16 insights → 4 strategy updates → 5 minutes," they're not being convinced through argument — they're experiencing why velocity culture works.

## The Pitch Narrative

### The Category Analogy

> "Quarterly strategy review is waterfall for strategy. Stratafy is agile for strategy."

This single line reframes the entire conversation. We're not building a faster strategy tool — we're creating the shift from periodic to continuous strategic alignment.

### The Headline Metric

**95% reduction in strategy review overhead.**

- Traditional quarterly review: 40-80 person-hours over 3-6 weeks
- Stratafy continuous loop: 5-10 minutes per review cycle
- Annual comparison: 160 person-hours → ~9 hours

But the real value isn't time saved — it's **decisions not missed**. Traditional reviews are lossy. Insights die in Slack. Context evaporates. By the time you get to the quarterly meeting, half the learning is gone.

### The Demo Opener

> "I just ran a strategic review. 16 insights analyzed, 4 strategies updated, 1 new initiative created. It took 5 minutes. Want to see?"

Then show it. Live. With your own workspace.

### The Three Proof Points

| Proof Point | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| **It works** | Founder uses Stratafy to run Stratafy. 2-3 days of strategic work in 2 hours. Real workspace, real content. |
| **It's needed** | 70-90% of strategies fail to execute. $3.7T annual value lost to execution gaps. |
| **It's now** | AI can finally consume and reason against strategic context. 12-18 month window before incumbents move. |

## Positioning for Investors

- **Founder-market fit**: Lived the problem at Troop — velocity culture without infrastructure, couldn't get buy-in without proof
- **Timing fit**: Category-creation window is now (12-18 months before incumbents)
- **Technical fit**: AI-native from day one, not retrofitted
- **Traction fit**: Early customers demonstrating value, founder dogfooding daily
- **Category fit**: "Agile for Strategy" — a shift, not a feature

## The Market Opportunity

| Level | Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Value at stake** | $3.7T/year | Annual value lost to strategy execution gaps |
| **TAM** | $15-20B | Strategic planning + execution software |
| **SAM** | $3-5B | AI-forward companies needing strategic infrastructure |
| **SOM (5-year)** | $200-500M | Realistic capture with category leadership |

## Why Sequoia

Roelof Botha specifically:
- Board member at MongoDB, Block — sees strategy execution challenges firsthand
- Could use Stratafy for portfolio visibility (strategic alignment across 50+ companies)
- Reputation for hands-on, product-focused investing
- SA connection (founder is South African)

The pitch isn't just "invest in Stratafy" — it's "here's how you could see strategic drift across your entire portfolio."

## Capability Requirements

- Pitch materials (deck, memo, demo)
- Investor network access (Sequoia path via Pieter de Villiers)
- Documented traction and metrics
- Clear use-of-funds narrative
- Founding story narrative (developed and rehearsed)

## Success Indicators

- 10+ quality investor meetings
- Term sheet received
- Round closed at appropriate valuation
- Strategic investors who add value beyond capital
- Investors reference the founding story in follow-up conversations

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains—explicit choices about what we will NOT do:

- We do NOT optimize pitch for maximum valuation—optimize for right partners
- We do NOT distract from product/customers for fundraising theater
- We do NOT pursue funding before having something to show
- We do NOT accept terms that compromise long-term vision
- We do NOT pitch with slides when we can demo live
- We do NOT hide the Troop experience — it's founder-market fit evidence

## Target Round

- **Stage**: Pre-Seed / Seed
- **Target**: ~$5M by Q3 2026
- **Optimal Pitch Window**: Q2-Q3 2026 (April-June)

## Key Milestones Before Pitching

- MVP with core functionality
- 2-3 beta customers
- Early traction signals
- Referenceable testimonials
- Demo that runs flawlessly
- Founding story narrative polished

## Investor Strategy

**Primary Path**: Sequoia via Pieter de Villiers → Roelof Botha

**Backup Paths**:
- a16z / Greylock direct outreach
- SA investors (Knife Capital, 4Di)
- Angel investors

## Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation Deadline |
|----|------------|------------|---------------------|
| A6 | Pieter will make Sequoia introduction | 70% | April 2026 |
| A19 | "Agile for Strategy" analogy resonates with investors | 75% | First 3 pitch meetings |
| A20 | 95% overhead reduction metric is compelling | 80% | Investor reactions |
| A24 | Founding story (Troop → Stratafy) strengthens founder-market fit perception | 75% | Investor reactions |

## Pivot Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Pieter declines or delays introduction past June 2026 | Activate backup investor paths immediately |
| Seed round not closed by September 2026 | Extend runway, reduce scope, consider alternative funding |
| "Agile for Strategy" doesn't land | Test alternative framings: "Strategic OS", "Continuous Alignment" |
| Founding story creates concerns about Troop exit | Reframe emphasis toward lessons learned, reduce Troop specifics |

## If Assumptions Prove False

**A6 (No Sequoia intro)**: Accelerate a16z/Greylock paths, pursue SA investors (Knife Capital, 4Di), consider angels.

**A19/A20 (Messaging doesn't land)**: Iterate on pitch based on feedback. Lead with demo, let product speak.

**A24 (Founding story backfires)**: Focus on forward-looking narrative, reduce Troop references, emphasize product evidence over personal journey.

## Next Actions

| Action | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Develop founding story narrative (Troop → Stratafy) | Leonard | March 2026 |
| Complete Alignment Scan MVP | Leonard | Feb 10 |
| Prepare 1-pager for Pieter | Leonard | March 25 |
| Request intro from Pieter | Leonard | Late March |

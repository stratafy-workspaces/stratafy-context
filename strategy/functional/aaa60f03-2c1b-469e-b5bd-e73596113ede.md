# Clickatell Pieter Engagement

## Description
Pieter de Villiers is both the warm path to Sequoia AND a potential lighthouse customer. Dual value: investor intro + use case validation.

THE OPPORTUNITY:

Pieter expressed excitement about Stratafy acting as his Chief of Staff. This is the AI Chief of Staff use case — Stratafy + Agent + Linear giving a CEO leverage without management overhead.

DUAL ANGLE:
1. As investor connector — Warm intro to Roelof at Sequoia (existing path)
2. As customer — CEO using AI Chief of Staff, validates use case, becomes reference

WHY PURSUE BOTH:

If Pieter uses Stratafy and loves it, the Sequoia intro becomes: I use this myself. You should look at it.

THE OFFERING:

Not just Stratafy — the full AI Chief of Staff stack:
- Stratafy workspace with his strategic context
- Chief of Staff agent configured for him
- Linear integration for coordination
- Telegram for escalations

ENGAGEMENT APPROACH:

After ScaleUp Company meeting (Feb 16), reach out. Position him as early adopter, not favor-asker.

WHAT WE LEARN:

ScaleUp Company = Advisory firm use case (multi-client deployment)
Pieter = CEO use case (individual executive leverage)

Two different perspectives. Both valid. The feedback shapes the product.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Pieter agrees to pilot
- Uses it for 2+ weeks
- Provides feedback on CEO-specific needs
- Sequoia intro happens with product context

TIMELINE:
- Feb 16: ScaleUp meeting (priority)
- Late Feb: Pieter outreach
- March: Pieter pilot if interested
- April: Sequoia intro (with Pieter as user, not just connector)

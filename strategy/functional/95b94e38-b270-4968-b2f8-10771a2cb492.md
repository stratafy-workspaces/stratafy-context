# Advisory Firms as Customer Segment

## Description
Target strategy advisory and consulting firms as a primary GTM channel. They onboard clients through existing strategy engagements, get continuous visibility, create lock-in, and earn revenue share. Critically: Stratafy is also their hedge against AI disruption.

THE MARKET REALITY:
Advisory firms know AI is coming for them. Strategy consulting is exactly the kind of knowledge work LLMs are getting good at. Their fear: clients use Claude directly and skip the consultant. This creates urgency.

VALUE PROPOSITION - GROWTH:
1. Continuous Client Visibility - dashboard across all clients
2. Strategic Interface - clients interact through Stratafy, advisor stays connected
3. Insight Generation - pattern recognition across portfolio
4. Client Lock-in - strategy lives in Stratafy, switching means migration
5. Revenue Share - recurring revenue on every client onboarded

VALUE PROPOSITION - AI HEDGE:
1. Become Infrastructure - even if AI handles strategy work, clients context lives in system they control and earn from
2. Revenue Transition - as consulting revenue declines, Stratafy revenue share grows
3. Stay in Loop - they see when clients need help, become escalation layer
4. Lock-in Outlasts Relationship - clients still on Stratafy even if they stop hiring for projects

GTM MOTION:
- Land with advisory firm, deploy to clients post-engagement
- Revenue share on client subscriptions
- Natural onboarding: strategy session to Stratafy handoff

INITIAL TARGET: ScaleUp Company

PITCH (Growth): You do the strategy work. Stratafy makes it stick. Earn recurring revenue on every client.

PITCH (AI Hedge): AI will change your business. Be the one who gives clients strategic AI infrastructure and earn revenue whether they need consulting or not.

# SEO Strategy

## Description
Drive organic growth through content that serves dual purposes: SEO rankings and pitch support. Every piece of content advances the category narrative.

UPDATED KEYWORD TARGETS (reflecting today's clarity):

Category-defining terms:
- Strategic operating system
- Control plane for AI
- AI governance for business
- Strategic Health Index
- Organizational AI governance

Problem-focused terms:
- AI context problem
- AI visibility enterprise
- AI agent governance
- Strategy execution gap
- AI without guardrails

Flywheel and measurement terms:
- Compounding strategic intelligence
- Strategy metrics
- Loop closure rate
- AI activity monitoring

CONTENT PILLARS (Updated):

1. The Four Problems - Context, Visibility, Freshness, Guardrails
2. Document to Infrastructure - The transformation narrative
3. The Flywheel - Compounding value, why switching is hard
4. Strategic Health Index - Measuring what matters
5. AI Governance - Control plane positioning
6. Execution Principles - Velocity with alignment

DUAL POSITIONING IN CONTENT:

Some content leads with strategy (Strategic Operating System)
Some content leads with AI governance (Control Plane)
Both point to the same product, different buyer entry points

SUCCESS METRICS:

Phase 0 (now): 7 articles, investor credibility
Phase 1: Top 10 rankings for category terms
Phase 2: Strategic Health Index cited as industry reference
Phase 3: Flywheel metrics published, benchmarks established

## Content
# SEO & Content Strategy

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: How do we build organic visibility that supports category creation and sales enablement?

**Time Horizon**: 2026-2027 (phased growth)

**Strategic Theme**: Build organic search presence through problem education content that serves dual purposes—SEO rankings and pitch/sales support. Every piece of content should be usable in both contexts.

## 🐕 Eating Our Own Dog Food

**This strategy is managed in Stratafy.**

The SEO strategy itself lives in Stratafy's strategy tree, linked to the Category Creation parent strategy. Content calendar, metrics, and progress are tracked through the system.

| Phase | Dogfooding Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Phase 0** (Now) | Strategy documented in Stratafy; content workflow uses AI assistance with human approval |
| **Phase 1** (Post-funding) | Publish "How Stratafy Manages Our Content Strategy" case study |
| **Phase 2+** (Scale) | Make blog content API-queryable; full transparency on human-AI collaboration |

We sequence the reveal: demonstrate internally first, publish proof points after funding, open the kimono at scale.

## Dual-Purpose Content Approach

Content serves two masters simultaneously:

| Purpose | Goal | Success Indicator |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Pitch Support** | Investors say "I read your article" | Content cited in meetings |
| **SEO Foundation** | Rank for category-defining terms | Top 10 rankings for pillar keywords |
| **Thought Leadership** | Position as category authority | Cited in publications, invited to speak |
| **Sales Enablement** | Content closes deals | "Read your article" in sales conversations |

## Content Principles

1. **Problem education over solution promotion** — 80% problem/insight, 20% solution
2. **Original frameworks over recycled ideas** — Would an investor quote this?
3. **Data-backed over opinion-based** — Every claim needs a citation
4. **Timeless foundations over trending topics** — Valuable in 2028?
5. **Dual-use by design** — Works in blog AND pitch meeting
6. **Generic education in Phase 0** — No proprietary reveals before funding
7. **Human-AI collaboration** — AI assists ideation/drafting, human approves and refines
8. **Lived experience over theory** — Draw from Troop experience, not just research

## The 8 Content Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Core Question |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **1. First Principles** | What strategy actually is | Why do strategies fail? |
| **2. Business Stages** | Strategy by company size | Who needs what? |
| **3. AI Era** | Why AI changes everything | Why now? |
| **4. Measuring Success** | Why current metrics fail | What's broken? |
| **5. Foundation + AI** | Core thesis | What's the answer? |
| **6. AI Technical** | MCP, protocols, architectures | How does AI work? |
| **7. AI Tools** | Tool profiles, ecosystem | What can I use? |
| **8. Startup Execution Principles** | What fastest companies do differently | How do the best operate? |

**Pillar flow**: 
- Problem path: 1→2→3→4→5 (problem to solution)
- Technical path: 6→7→5 (technical validation)
- Execution path: 8→1→5 (principles to strategy to solution)

## Pillar 8: Startup Execution Principles

**Pillar page**: "Startup Execution Principles: What the Fastest-Growing Companies Do Differently"

This pillar draws from founder's direct experience at Troop, research on Linear/Ramp/Tesla, and the Stratafy thesis. It's not recycled advice — it's earned insight from living the problem.

### Why This Pillar Matters

- **Unique perspective**: Lived the velocity problem at Troop, couldn't systematize it, got pushed out
- **Research-backed**: Deep dive into Linear, Ramp, Tesla methodologies
- **Solution-connected**: Each principle leads naturally to Stratafy thesis
- **Pitch-ready**: Every article supports the founder-market fit narrative

### Pillar 8 Article Sequence (Updated)

| Priority | Article | Principle | Keyword Targets |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Velocity as Religion: How the Fastest Companies Actually Operate** | Velocity Research | startup velocity, Ramp growth, Linear methodology, Tesla innovation |
| 2 | **Why Velocity Culture Fails (And How to Fix It)** | Velocity Problem | startup velocity culture, move fast culture, velocity vs quality |
| 3 | **The Founder's Bottleneck: When Strategy Lives in Your Head** | Systematization | founder bottleneck, scaling founder knowledge |
| 4 | **The False Trade-off: Velocity vs. Process** | Alignment | velocity vs process, agile vs planning, startup process |
| 5 | **The Execution Gap Explained** | Problem Education | strategy execution gap, why strategies fail |
| 6 | **AI-Augmented Founder: Working at 3-5x Capacity** | AI Leverage | AI for founders, AI startup tools, founder productivity |
| 7 | **Quarterly to Continuous: The Feedback Loop That Replaces Reviews** | Continuous Alignment | continuous strategy, quarterly review alternative |

### Article Details

**Article 1: Velocity as Religion (LEAD ARTICLE)**
- Hook: "The fastest-growing companies treat velocity as religion. Not 'move fast and break things' — something more disciplined. Here's what they actually do, and why most companies can't copy them."
- Thesis: The best companies (Tesla, Ramp, Linear) share common velocity patterns. But without infrastructure, you can't copy them.
- Evidence: Elon Musk quotes, Ramp podcast, Linear methodology, Sequoia spotlight
- Bridge to Stratafy: The missing piece is infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable
- See: Detailed brief below

**Article 2: Why Velocity Culture Fails**
- Hook: "The best founders know velocity wins. So why do teams resist it?"
- Thesis: Velocity without alignment feels like chaos. Teams push back not because they're slow, but because they can't see the logic.
- Evidence: Troop experience, builds on Article 1 research
- Bridge to Stratafy: Infrastructure that makes velocity sustainable

**Article 3: The Founder's Bottleneck**
- Hook: "The strategy is in your head. That's the problem."
- Thesis: Founders who hold context in their heads become bottlenecks. Every decision requires them. This doesn't scale.
- Evidence: Troop email ("details are more in our heads than in a product"), common founder pattern
- Bridge to Stratafy: Strategic context that's queryable, not just remembered

**Article 4: The False Trade-off**
- Hook: "Traditional product management trades velocity for process. That's the wrong answer."
- Thesis: You shouldn't have to choose between speed and coherence. The trade-off is a symptom of missing infrastructure.
- Evidence: Linear "Agile is outdated" positioning, Ramp "velocity over everything"
- Bridge to Stratafy: Velocity WITH alignment, not velocity OR alignment

**Article 5: The Execution Gap Explained**
- Hook: "70-90% of strategies fail to execute. The problem isn't the strategy."
- Thesis: The execution gap is structural, not cultural. It's an infrastructure problem.
- Evidence: McKinsey/HBR research, $3.7T annual value lost
- Bridge to Stratafy: Strategic Operating System thesis

**Article 6: AI-Augmented Founder**
- Hook: "I'm a solo founder shipping at 3-5x normal capacity. Here's how."
- Thesis: AI tools don't just save time — they change what's possible for a solo founder
- Evidence: Stratafy proof points (16 insights → 5 min, strategy tree in 2 days)
- Bridge to Stratafy: AI leverage is the thesis in action

**Article 7: Quarterly to Continuous**
- Hook: "Quarterly strategy reviews are waterfall for strategy. There's a better way."
- Thesis: Continuous feedback loops beat periodic reviews — faster learning, fewer missed decisions
- Evidence: Jan 27 proof point (16 insights → 4 updates → 5 min)
- Bridge to Stratafy: The loop IS the product

## Future Pillar (Phase 2+)

**Pillar 9: Human-AI Collaboration in Practice** — How we use AI for content with human oversight. Publish prompts, approval workflows, decision criteria. Radical transparency once we have the credibility to back it up.

## Phased Approach

### Phase 0: Foundation (Jan-Mar 2026)
- **Focus**: Pitch credibility, not rankings
- **Goal**: Substantive content when investors search
- **Cadence**: 1 article/week (sustainable for solo founder)
- **Target**: 7 articles published before pitch window
- **Pillar focus**: Pillar 8 (Execution Principles) + Pillar 1 (First Principles)
- **Dogfooding**: Internal only — strategy in Stratafy, AI-assisted writing

### Phase 1: Growth (Apr-Dec 2026)
- **Focus**: Fill pitch gaps, start customer content
- **Goal**: Top 10 rankings for 5-10 keywords
- **Cadence**: 2-4 articles/month
- **Dogfooding**: Publish case study on using Stratafy for content strategy

### Phase 2+: Scale (2027+)
- **Focus**: Category dominance
- **Goal**: Top 3 rankings for primary terms
- **Cadence**: Weekly publication with team
- **Dogfooding**: API-queryable content, full human-AI workflow transparency

## Category Creation Keywords

These emerging keywords have low competition—opportunity to define the category:

| Keyword | Current Volume | Opportunity |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| "strategic operating system" | <50/mo | Define the category |
| "organizational identity AI" | <20/mo | Own the concept |
| "continuous strategy alignment" | <30/mo | Own the cadence shift |
| "AI agent governance" | <100/mo | Own governance narrative |
| "MCP for business" | <50/mo | Define protocol for business |
| "startup velocity culture" | <100/mo | Own the execution narrative |
| "velocity vs process" | <50/mo | Own the trade-off reframe |
| "Ramp velocity" | <50/mo | Capture research interest |
| "Linear methodology" | <100/mo | Capture research interest |

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 (Jan-Mar 2026)
- Articles published: 7
- Unique visitors: 500+
- Time on page: >3 min average
- LinkedIn shares by investors: 1+
- Pillar 8 articles: 5+ published

### Phase 1-2 (Apr-Dec 2026)
- Organic traffic: 2,000+ monthly
- Keywords in top 10: 5+
- Newsletter subscribers: 100+
- "Read your article" mentions: 3+
- **Narrative adoption** — Track prospects/analysts using Stratafy terminology

### Phase 3+ (2027)
- Organic traffic: 10,000+ monthly
- Keywords in top 3: 10+
- Content-attributed leads: 20%+ of pipeline
- **Terminology tracking** — "Strategic operating system" and "velocity with alignment" mentions in publications

### Strategic Success Metric (All Phases)

**Narrative Adoption Rate**: % of prospects, analysts, and publications using Stratafy terminology ("strategic operating system," "continuous alignment," "velocity with alignment," "foundation layer"). Tracked quarterly. This measures category creation, not just traffic.

## Strategic Constraints

- We do NOT chase trending topics over timeless foundations
- We do NOT reveal proprietary architecture before funding (Phase 0)
- We do NOT create content that only serves one purpose (SEO OR pitch)
- We do NOT publish weak content under time pressure—delay if needed
- We do NOT position as "just another OKR tool"
- We do NOT publish without human review of AI-assisted drafts
- We do NOT write theory without lived experience — every principle connects to real evidence

### Future Constraint (Phase 2+)

"Every article must be structured as queryable infrastructure—if it can't be consumed by an AI agent via API, it doesn't ship."

*This constraint activates when we have the technical capacity and market credibility to back it up.*

## Content as Infrastructure (Phase 2+ Vision)

When we reach scale, content becomes infrastructure:

| Capability | Description | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Structured data** | JSON-LD schema on all articles | Phase 1 |
| **API endpoints** | AI agents can query article content | Phase 2 |
| **Semantic search** | Internal teams query content programmatically | Phase 2+ |
| **Embeddings** | Content indexed for AI retrieval | Phase 2+ |

This operationalizes our belief: "Strategy must be consumable by both humans and AI."

## Link Building Strategy

| Phase | Sources | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Phase 0 | Founder LinkedIn, 1-2 guest posts | Share articles, pitch thought leadership |
| Phase 1-2 | Research citations, partner blogs | Original data, guest posts |
| Phase 3+ | Analysts, customer sites, aggregators | Gartner/Forrester, co-marketing |

## Technical SEO Requirements

- Blog at /blog/[slug] with proper structure
- Meta titles/descriptions optimized
- Schema markup for articles (Article, Organization)
- Site speed <3s, mobile responsive
- XML sitemap, Google Search Console connected

## Integration with Initiatives

- **Content Foundation Initiative** (Phase 0): 7 foundational articles (5+ from Pillar 8)
- **Phase 1**: "How Stratafy Manages Content Strategy" case study
- **Phase 2+**: API-queryable content, Human-AI workflow transparency

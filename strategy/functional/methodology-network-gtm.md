# Methodology Network GTM

## Description
Go-to-market strategy targeting advisory firms and certified coaches across all major strategy methodology networks (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard, 4DX). The public positioning is additive: Stratafy makes your methodology persist between sessions, gives you cross-portfolio visibility, and prepares your clients for AI governance. The internal trajectory is subsumption: over 12-24 months, Stratafy becomes the system of record while methodologies become vocabulary. Distribution model: one coach = many client deployments. Revenue model: coach gets premium features (portfolio analytics, branded reports, cross-client intelligence), clients get workspace subscriptions. Leonard has warm relationships with coaches across Scaling Up and other methodology networks — this is an existing distribution advantage to activate.

# Fundraising Playbook

## Description
Operational playbook for executing the seed fundraise. Consolidates investor pathways, timeline, materials, demo strategy, and pitch narrative.

THE SHIFT (Feb 11, 2026): Madrona is now primary pathway, Sequoia secondary. Ted Kummert relationship (warm, existing from Troop) provides faster entry. Having Madrona engaged creates natural urgency for Sequoia.

INVESTOR PATHWAYS:

Primary — Madrona (Ted Kummert, Venture Partner): Warm relationship, $5M seed sweet spot, enterprise infrastructure thesis. Critical intel: Madrona struggling with AI context — our exact problem. Ignatius as pre-scout. Timeline: late Feb outreach, call early March. Dual angle: investor + customer.

Secondary — Sequoia (Roelof Botha via Pieter): Pieter meeting March, Sequoia intro April. Madrona engagement creates urgency.

Validation — Knife Capital (Keet van Zyl, direct connection): NOT a fundraise target. VC-as-customer validation play. Get Keet's perspective on portfolio visibility value prop before pitching Madrona/Sequoia. Schedule before Pieter meeting in March. See: VC as Customer > Knife Capital Engagement strategy.

Backup — a16z, 4Di, angels.

THE ASK: $2-5M seed, April-June 2026 window. 50-60% engineering, 20-25% GTM, 10-15% ops, 10% reserve.

DEMO PRINCIPLE: Don't pitch — let them experience it. The demo IS the pitch. Practice 10x minimum.

PITCH: "Every org is deploying AI agents with no strategic infrastructure. Stratafy is the nervous system. First paying customer live, 12-18 month window before incumbents move."

PRINCIPLES: Right partners over max valuation. Demo over slides. Real data over hypothetical. Use Stratafy to manage the fundraise (meta proof).

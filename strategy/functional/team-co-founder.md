# Team & Co-founder

## Description
Build the founding team that de-risks execution and strengthens the fundraise. Primary path: convert Ignatius from Troop. Fallback: broader search if primary path closes by April 2026.

# Team & Co-founder Strategy

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: How do we build the founding team that de-risks execution and strengthens the fundraise?

**Time Horizon**: Q1-Q2 2026

**Strategic Theme**: Convert Ignatius as technical co-founder. He's the right person, the timing window is opening, and the relationship is proven. This isn't a search — it's a conversion.

## Why This Matters Now

| Risk | Without Co-founder | With Co-founder |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Execution velocity | Constrained by solo capacity | 2x shipping speed minimum |
| Investor credibility | "Can he do this alone?" | "Proven team that's worked together" |
| Resilience | Single point of failure | Redundancy on critical path |
| Technical depth | Good enough | Excellent (his strength) |

Sequoia will ask about team. "My former engineering lead is joining" is a stronger answer than "I'm looking."

## Primary Path: Ignatius

### Why Him

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Technical capability** | Proven — was engineering lead at Troop |
| **Trust & working relationship** | 8 years working together, high trust established |
| **Vision alignment** | Understands and buys into Stratafy vision |
| **AI capability** | To be confirmed — but can learn fast |
| **Timing** | Troop running out of funding, he's unhappy but loyal |

### His Decision Calculus

**What pulls him toward Stratafy:**
- Escape from deteriorating Troop situation
- Belief in the vision (already established)
- Working with Leonard again (relationship)
- Ground-floor equity in something new
- Technical challenge in AI-native architecture

**What holds him back:**
- Financial risk — family to support
- Loyalty to Troop (even if unhappy)
- Uncertainty about Stratafy's funding/runway
- Timing — may want to see Troop play out

## The Conversion Timeline

### Key Trigger: Troop All-Hands (Mid-February 2026)

Troop has an all-team meeting with lead investor in ~3 weeks (mid-February). This will clarify Troop's trajectory — funding, restructuring, or wind-down. Ignatius will have much better visibility on his situation after this meeting.

### Phase 1: Stay Warm (Now → All-Hands)

- Regular contact — about life, not recruiting
- Share Stratafy progress naturally (wins, customer conversations, demos)
- Be a friend, not a recruiter — he's probably anxious
- **Goal**: He's thinking about Stratafy before you ask

**Do NOT**: Push, pitch, or make him feel pressured before he has clarity on Troop.

### Phase 2: Read the Situation (All-Hands + 1-2 weeks)

After the meeting, check in with empathy first:

> "How are you doing? That must have been intense."

Let him tell you where his head is. Don't lead with Stratafy.

| Troop Outcome | His Likely State | Your Move |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Troop is clearly dying** | Processing, maybe relieved | Give 1-2 weeks to process, then have the real conversation |
| **Troop gets short-term lifeline** | Conflicted — loyalty vs. reality | Gauge his read on the lifeline. Is it real or just延长ing the inevitable? |
| **Troop gets real funding** | May stay out of loyalty | Reassess timeline. He may not be available for 12+ months. Consider fallback. |
| **Ambiguous outcome** | Uncertain, stressed | Ask directly: "What are you thinking?" He'll tell you. |

### Phase 3: Formal Conversation (Late Feb - Mar)

When he signals readiness (or Troop situation is clearly resolved):

- Make the explicit ask: "I want you to join as co-founder. Let's talk about what that looks like."
- Address financial risk directly — see mitigation options below
- **Goal**: Clear answer or clear timeline to answer

### Phase 4: Close or Pivot (April 2026)

- If yes → Structure part-time start, transition plan
- If no or "not yet" → Activate fallback search
- If "maybe later" → Set check-in, but don't wait — proceed with fallback

---

## Addressing Financial Risk

This is his main blocker. Options to de-risk:

| Option | Description | Trade-off |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Part-time start** | He stays at Troop (or finds contract work) while doing 15-20 hrs/week on Stratafy | Slower, but low risk for him |
| **Runway guarantee** | Commit to 6-month salary from your funds/runway regardless of fundraise | Costs you cash, shows commitment |
| **Accelerated vesting** | Front-load vesting so he has meaningful equity faster | Dilution, but aligns incentives |
| **Seed contingency** | "Full-time when seed closes" — part-time until then | Delays full commitment |

**Recommended approach**: Part-time start now, full-time contingent on seed close, with runway guarantee for 6 months post-seed if fundraise is delayed.

### Equity Framework

For a true co-founder joining pre-seed:

| Scenario | Equity Range | Vesting |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Full co-founder (equal commitment from day 1) | 15-25% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| Co-founder joining post-vision (your situation) | 10-15% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| Early employee #1 (not co-founder title) | 3-7% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |

**Recommendation**: Offer 10-15% with co-founder title. He's not a hired engineer — he's your partner in building this. The title and equity should reflect that.

---

## Fallback Path: Broader Search

Only activate if Ignatius path closes definitively (he says no, or "not for 12+ months").

### Timeline Trigger

- **Decision point**: April 2026
- **If Ignatius is a no**: Begin active search immediately
- **If Ignatius is "maybe Q3"**: Parallel-path — light search while waiting

### Search Channels

| Channel | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **EO Network** | Warm intros to technical founders who've exited or are between things |
| **Pieter de Villiers** | Ask specifically: "Know any technical co-founder types?" |
| **Y Combinator network** | Co-founder matching, Hacker News "Who wants to be hired" |
| **On Deck / South Park Commons** | Founder communities with technical talent |
| **LinkedIn direct** | Target: ex-FAANG in SA, AI engineers who post about meaning/impact |

### Ideal Profile (If Not Ignatius)

- 7+ years engineering experience
- Shipped product at scale (startup or big tech)
- AI/ML familiarity (doesn't need to be specialist)
- Interested in strategy/business problems (not just technical puzzles)
- Comfortable with ambiguity and pace of pre-seed
- Remote-friendly (SA timezone overlap helpful but not required)

## Interim: What You Do While This Plays Out

You can't pause execution while waiting for co-founder clarity.

| If Ignatius joins part-time | If still waiting |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| He owns technical architecture decisions | You own architecture, get code reviews from advisors |
| He ships core features | You ship MVP yourself (slower) |
| He joins customer calls for technical credibility | You handle all customer calls |
| You prepare investor narrative: "co-founder joining" | You prepare narrative: "in discussions with co-founder candidate" |

---

## Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation |
|----|------------|------------|------------|
| A13 | Ignatius will be available (Troop situation resolves) by Q2 2026 | 65% | Troop all-hands outcome (mid-Feb), his signals |
| A14 | Financial risk can be mitigated with part-time + runway guarantee | 70% | Direct conversation |
| A15 | He'll say yes if the financial risk is addressed | 60% | His response to formal ask |

## Pivot Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Ignatius says definitive no | Activate fallback search immediately |
| Ignatius says "not until Q4 2026 or later" | Parallel search — can't wait that long |
| Troop gets funded and stabilizes | Re-assess his interest level; may need fallback |
| You find exceptional candidate through network | Have honest conversation with Ignatius about timeline pressure |

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains:

- We do NOT pressure Ignatius — this has to be his decision
- We do NOT wait indefinitely — April is the decision point
- We do NOT hire a random engineer and call them co-founder for optics
- We do NOT let co-founder search distract from shipping and customers
- We do NOT compromise on trust — only people you'd work with for 10 years

## Next Actions

| Action | Timeline | Owner |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Casual check-in with Ignatius (how's Troop, how's he doing?) | This week | Leonard |
| Stay warm — regular contact, no pressure | Now → mid-Feb | Leonard |
| Share ScaleUp Company pilot outcome naturally | After pilot | Leonard |
| **TRIGGER**: Troop all-hands with lead investor | Mid-February 2026 | — |
| Post all-hands check-in (empathy first) | All-hands + few days | Leonard |
| Gauge his headspace, read the situation | Late February | Leonard |
| Formal co-founder conversation (if he signals readiness) | Late Feb - March | Leonard |
| Prepare financial risk mitigation options | Before formal conversation | Leonard |
| Decision point: proceed or activate fallback | April 2026 | Leonard |

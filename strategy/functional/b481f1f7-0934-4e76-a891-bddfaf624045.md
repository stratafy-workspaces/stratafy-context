# Product-Market Fit

## Description
Prove value with early adopters. Target AI-forward startups (10-200 employees), position as strategic infrastructure for the AI era, lead with Strategic Advisor workflow as immediate value hook, differentiate from OKR tools by emphasizing continuous alignment.

# Product-Market Fit (S1)

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: Can we prove value with early adopters?

**Time Horizon**: Q1-Q3 2026

**Strategic Theme**: Validate the core value proposition with lighthouse customers before scaling.

## Positioning

- Target AI-forward startups and scaling companies (10-200 employees)
- Position as "strategic infrastructure for the AI era"
- **Lead with Strategic Advisor workflow as immediate value hook** — AI that knows full context, structures thinking in real-time, and writes directly into the system
- Differentiate from OKR tools by emphasizing continuous alignment, not periodic tracking

## The Strategic Advisor Workflow

This is our core value proposition — proven in founder use:

```
1. Express fuzzy intent → 2. AI structures and challenges → 3. AI writes to system → 4. Iterate → 5. Done
```

**Outcome**: 2-3 days of strategic work in 2 hours. This is what we sell.

## The Feedback Loop (Strategy Flows Both Directions)

The Strategic Advisor workflow includes a **bottom-up feedback loop** — execution insights surface and refine strategy:

```
Insights captured → AI analyzes against strategies → Recommendations surfaced → Human approves → Strategy updated
```

**Proof point**: January 27, 2026 — 16 insights analyzed, 4 strategies updated, 1 initiative created. Total time: 5 minutes.

This operationalizes the principle "Strategy flows both directions." It's not just top-down goal-setting; execution continuously informs strategy through AI-mediated feedback.

**Customer onboarding must include**: How to capture insights, how AI surfaces implications, how to approve changes.

## Capability Requirements

### Core (PMF Phase)
- Core strategy CRUD (define, link, version strategies)
- **Alignment Scan** for foundation-strategy coherence checking
- **Feedback Loop** for insight-to-strategy refinement
- MCP integration for AI agent access to workspace context
- Strategic Advisor system prompt for grounded AI conversations
- API-first architecture for AI agent consumption

### Sequenced for Later (Phase 2)
- **Pulse** (internal execution sensing) — deliberately Phase 2
- Full Tactics layer (objectives, metrics)
- Automated drift detection

**Why Pulse is Phase 2**: Continuous alignment is a core value, but we prove the loop manually first (Strategic Advisor + Feedback Loop), then automate sensing. This prevents scope creep while still demonstrating the paradigm shift.

## Success Indicators

### Human-Centric Metrics
- 3+ customers actively using product
- >80% activation rate
- 15-20% improvement in documented metrics
- NPS >50 from beta customers
- At least one referenceable testimonial
- Customers say "this saved me days of work"

### AI Consumption Metrics (NEW)
- MCP query volume per customer per week
- % of strategic context accessed via API (target: 50%+ by end of PMF)
- # of AI-mediated strategy updates per customer per month
- % of strategic decisions with AI involvement logged

### Directional Success Metrics (90%+ Trajectory)
- % of strategies with documented outcomes
- Average alignment score trend (improving over time)
- % of strategic decisions executed as intended
- Insight-to-action conversion rate

These early indicators point toward the 90%+ success rate vision, even if full measurement comes post-PMF.

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains—explicit choices about what we will NOT do:

- We do NOT pursue enterprise sales yet
- We do NOT build full Tactics layer yet
- We do NOT optimize for revenue—optimize for learning
- We do NOT expand features beyond core PMF scope
- We do NOT build Pulse in PMF phase — prove the loop manually first

## Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation Deadline |
|----|------------|------------|---------------------|
| A1 | **Strategic Advisor workflow is the immediate value hook** | 80% | End of Q1 2026 |
| A2 | AI-forward startups/scale-ups are the right first segment | 75% | End of Q2 2026 |
| A3 | Solo founder can ship MVP in 8 weeks | 60% | March 2026 |
| A8 | PMF can be proven with 3 customers | 70% | End of Q1 2026 |
| A9 | Alignment scoring adds measurable customer value | 70% | Customer feedback |
| A10 | AI can reliably detect strategy-execution gaps | 65% | Accuracy metrics |
| A11 | Customers will connect internal systems for Pulse | 60% | Integration adoption |
| A12 | Drift detection provides actionable insights | 70% | Action rate on alerts |

### Parallel Validation for A1 (De-risking)

A1 is the entire value proposition at 80% confidence. Don't wait for failure to pivot.

**Proactive mitigation**: Run parallel validation with 1-2 early customers:
- Customer A: Strategic Advisor-first workflow (primary)
- Customer B: Alignment Scan-first workflow (alternative)
- Customer C: Radar-first workflow (if capacity)

If Strategic Advisor isn't the hook by end of Q1, have validated alternative ready to deploy immediately. This reduces pivot time from months to weeks.

## Pivot Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 0 customers onboarded by end of March 2026 | Re-evaluate product direction, value proposition, or segment |
| 3 customers but 0% see measurable improvement | Pivot value proposition or target outcome |
| Customers consistently request X instead of Strategic Advisor | Fast-follow to build X, re-sequence roadmap |
| A1 parallel validation shows alternative outperforms | Pivot to winning workflow immediately |

## If Assumptions Prove False

**A1 (Strategic Advisor not the hook)**: Deploy pre-validated alternative (Radar-first or Alignment Scan-first) immediately.

**A2 (Wrong segment)**: Test traditional enterprises (larger budgets, slower cycles) or strategy consultants (channel partners).

**A3 (Can't ship in time)**: Reduce MVP scope further, find technical co-founder, or extend timeline.

## Alignment Scan Results (Jan 27, 2026)

**Overall Score: 7.8/10** | Confidence: High

| Element | Score | Key Finding |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Mission | 8/10 | Strategic Advisor demonstrates shared infrastructure |
| Vision | 7/10 | Now includes directional 90%+ indicators |
| Beliefs | 8/10 | Strong on execution gap, AI consumption |
| Values | 8/10 | Human primacy, earned trust well-reflected |
| Principles | 7/10 | Feedback loop now documented; Pulse sequencing explained |

**Addressed in this update:**
- ✅ AI consumption metrics added
- ✅ Feedback loop (bottom-up) documented with proof point
- ✅ Directional success metrics for 90%+ trajectory
- ✅ Pulse sequencing explained (intentionally Phase 2)
- ✅ Parallel validation for A1 de-risking added

# AI Leverage & Automation

## Description
Systematically deploy AI tools to multiply founder capacity, automate workflows, and generate continuous proof points. This strategy operationalizes the thesis: if Stratafy enables AI-augmented organizations, the founder must demonstrate it first.

# AI Leverage & Automation

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: How do we operate at 3-5x solo founder capacity while creating proof points for the Stratafy thesis?

**Time Horizon**: Ongoing (continuous improvement)

**Strategic Theme**: Use AI tools and agents systematically to multiply founder capacity. This is both operational necessity AND thesis validation — if Stratafy enables AI-augmented organizations, the founder must demonstrate it first.

## Why This Matters

| Without AI Leverage | With AI Leverage |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Solo founder = bottleneck | Solo founder = multiplied capacity |
| "How can you do this alone?" | "Here's how AI changes what's possible" |
| Theory about AI-augmented orgs | Lived proof of AI-augmented founder |
| Scattered tool usage | Systematic automation with metrics |

**The meta-point**: Every hour saved through AI automation is a proof point for investors. Every workflow automated is a case study for customers. This isn't just efficiency — it's the product thesis in action.

## Current AI Stack

### Strategic & Knowledge Work

| Domain | Tools | Automation Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| Strategic thinking | Claude + Stratafy MCP | High | Core workflow, daily use |
| Strategy reviews | Stratafy Alignment Scan | High | 16 insights → 4 updates → 5 min |
| Research & analysis | Claude web search | High | Market research, competitor analysis |
| Writing & content | Claude + human review | Medium | AI drafts, human refines |

### Operations & Execution

| Domain | Tools | Automation Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| CRM management | Attio + Claude MCP | Low → Medium | Needs systematic automation |
| Code development | Claude Code / Cursor | High | Primary development workflow |
| Meeting prep | Manual | Low | Gap — should be automated |
| Follow-up tracking | Mental / manual | Low | Gap — should be in Attio |
| Analytics | Manual | Low | Dashboard initiative in progress |

### Communication

| Domain | Tools | Automation Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| Email drafting | Claude | Medium | Ad-hoc, not systematic |
| Slack/messaging | Manual | Low | Not automated |
| Meeting notes | Manual | Low | Gap — should capture to CRM |

## Automation Principles

1. **AI drafts, human approves** — Human primacy is non-negotiable. AI proposes, human disposes.

2. **Automate the repeatable, keep the judgment** — Pattern work goes to AI. Novel decisions stay with humans.

3. **Every automation must be explainable** — If you can't explain what the AI did, don't automate it.

4. **Document what works** — Every successful automation becomes a product proof point.

5. **MCP-first where possible** — Prefer MCP integrations over copy-paste workflows. Queryable beats manual.

6. **Fail gracefully** — When automation fails, the workflow shouldn't break. Human fallback always exists.

## Workflow Automation Targets

### Priority 1: CRM & Relationship Management (Feb 2026)

| Workflow | Current State | Target State | Tools |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Post-meeting notes | Manual or forgotten | AI captures key points, updates Attio | Claude + Attio MCP |
| Pipeline stage updates | Manual clicks | AI suggests based on conversation signals | Attio + rules |
| Next action setting | Mental tracking | AI proposes next action after each interaction | Claude + Attio |
| Contact enrichment | Manual research | AI researches and populates context | Claude + web search |

### Priority 2: Meeting & Context Prep (Mar 2026)

| Workflow | Current State | Target State | Tools |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Pre-meeting research | Manual lookup | AI pulls CRM + Stratafy context into brief | Claude + MCPs |
| Agenda preparation | Manual | AI drafts agenda based on pipeline stage | Claude |
| Talking points | Mental | AI suggests based on strategic priorities | Stratafy + Claude |

### Priority 3: Content & Communication (Q2 2026)

| Workflow | Current State | Target State | Tools |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Article drafting | AI-assisted, ad-hoc | AI drafts from approved outline systematically | Claude + workflow |
| Email follow-ups | Manual composition | AI drafts based on CRM context | Claude + Attio |
| Weekly updates | Manual | AI summarizes activity, suggests focus | Claude + integrations |

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Tracking |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Hours saved per week | ~10 (estimate) | 20+ | Weekly log |
| Workflows with AI involvement | ~40% | 80% | Audit quarterly |
| Manual CRM updates | ~90% | <30% | Attio analytics |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Tracking |
|--------|--------|----------|
| AI draft acceptance rate | >70% | Sample review |
| Error rate requiring correction | <10% | Incident log |
| Context accuracy in AI outputs | >90% | Spot checks |

### Proof Point Metrics

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Documented automation wins | 5+ | Investor conversations |
| Time comparisons (before/after) | 3+ workflows | Pitch deck evidence |
| "AI-augmented founder" stories | 2+ | Content marketing |

## The Proof Point Narrative

Every automation success becomes ammunition:

**For investors**: "I'm a solo founder operating at 3-5x capacity because I use AI systematically. Here's the data."

**For customers**: "We built this because we use it. Here's how we run Stratafy with Stratafy + AI."

**For category creation**: "This is what AI-augmented organizations look like. We're the proof."

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains:

- We do NOT automate without human approval on outputs
- We do NOT use AI for judgment calls that require founder intuition
- We do NOT let automation complexity exceed the time it saves
- We do NOT automate before documenting the manual workflow
- We do NOT hide AI usage — radical transparency about human-AI collaboration
- We do NOT pursue automation that can't become a proof point

## Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation |
|----|------------|------------|------------|
| A28 | MCP integrations can handle 80% of CRM automation | 70% | Test with Attio MCP |
| A29 | AI-drafted content requires <30% human editing | 75% | Track acceptance rate |
| A30 | Automation documentation creates investor value | 80% | Pitch meeting reactions |
| A31 | Solo founder can maintain automation systems | 65% | Quarterly complexity audit |

## Pivot Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Automation maintenance exceeds time saved | Simplify or eliminate that automation |
| AI error rate exceeds 20% | Pause automation, investigate, retrain |
| MCP integrations unreliable | Fall back to manual + document the gap |
| Complexity overwhelms | Prune to top 3 highest-value automations |

## Relationship to Other Strategies

- **Enables**: Product-Market Fit — founder capacity to ship and support customers
- **Proves**: Category Leadership — thesis validation through self-use
- **Supports**: Funding & Growth — "AI-augmented founder" narrative
- **Demonstrates**: Product Architecture — MCP consumption in action

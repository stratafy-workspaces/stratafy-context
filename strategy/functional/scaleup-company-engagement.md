# ScaleUp Company Engagement

## Description
First external lighthouse customer for the Advisory Firms channel. ScaleUp Company already does strategy work with their clients—Stratafy becomes where that strategy lives.

CUSTOMER SEQUENCING PRINCIPLE:
1. Stratafy first - We are our own lighthouse customer. The more we use the product ourselves, the more we learn and prove the point. Dogfooding is not optional; it is the foundation of credibility.
2. Direct customers - ScaleUp Company and other direct users. They use Stratafy for their own strategy, give feedback, help us iterate.
3. Channel customers - ScaleUp clients and other companies reached through channels. Only after we have proven value with direct users.

SCALEUP ENGAGEMENT PHASES:

Phase 1: Onboard ScaleUp as Direct User
- Get their own strategy into Stratafy
- Let them experience Strategic Advisor, Alignment Scan on their own context
- Learn what works, what is missing, what is confusing
- Their friction becomes our roadmap

Phase 2: Learn from Their Usage
- What does an advisory firm actually need to see about clients?
- What dashboard view makes them say I need this?
- What is missing before they would deploy to their clients?
- Document insights for product and pitch refinement

Phase 3: Expand to Their Clients
- Co-design the client onboarding flow with ScaleUp
- Pilot with 1-2 of their clients
- ScaleUp earns revenue share, gains lock-in
- Document outcomes as case study for other advisory firms and investors

TIMING:
- STIR kickoff: Feb 17 (first paying customer — learnings feed ScaleUp prep)
- ScaleUp demo: Feb 23 (one week of STIR experience informs demo)
- Phase 1 (ScaleUp as user) starts immediately after successful demo
- Phase 2 learning period: March-April
- Phase 3 (client expansion) target: Q2 2026

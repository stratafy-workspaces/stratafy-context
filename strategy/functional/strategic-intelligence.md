# Strategic Intelligence

## Description
The Cortex layer capabilities that make organizations smarter over time. Four intelligence capabilities: Insights capture what's being learned. Decisions capture what's being chosen. Radar scans the external environment through your strategic lens. Synthesis connects them all. Together they form the learning loop — the organization's capacity to sense internally, scan externally, decide, and improve continuously. This is the intelligence that compounds and creates the cold-start moat.

# Strategic Intelligence

## Strategic Intent

**Question answered**: How does the system make organizations smarter over time?

**Time Horizon**: Q1-Q4 2026 (phased capability build)

**Strategic Theme**: Build the Cortex layer — the intelligence capabilities that sense, decide, and learn continuously. This is where compounding value lives and where the cold-start moat forms.

## Why This Matters

Traditional strategy tools are static. You put information in, you get reports out. Nothing learns. Nothing compounds.

Stratafy's Strategic Intelligence layer is different:

| Traditional Tools | Strategic Intelligence |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Store documents | Capture learnings as structured insights |
| Track decisions in meeting notes | Log decisions with context, rationale, outcomes |
| Quarterly reviews find problems late | Continuous sensing surfaces issues early |
| Knowledge walks out the door | Institutional memory persists and compounds |
| Every new employee starts cold | New team members query the accumulated intelligence |
| Generic industry news | External intelligence filtered through YOUR strategy |

**The compound effect**: Every insight captured, every decision logged, every radar scan analyzed makes the system smarter. Competitors who start later face an ever-widening intelligence gap.

## The Four Intelligence Capabilities

### 1. Insights — Internal Sensing Intelligence

**What it is**: Structured capture of learnings, observations, and signals from across the organization.

**How it works**:
- Insights are captured from conversations, sessions, reviews
- AI categorizes by type (strategic, operational, customer, etc.)
- AI surfaces connections to existing strategies
- Human approves which insights warrant strategy updates
- Feedback loop closes: insight → analysis → update → execution

**Current state**: 60+ insights captured, actively used in Strategic Feedback Reviews

**Value**:
- Nothing falls through the cracks
- Patterns emerge across many small observations  
- Ground-level reality surfaces to strategic level
- AI can query "what have we learned about X?"

### 2. Decisions — Choice Intelligence

**What it is**: Structured log of decisions with full context preservation.

**How it works**:
- Decisions logged with: title, description, context snapshot, rationale
- Linked to relevant strategies and initiatives
- Typed as Type 1 (irreversible) or Type 2 (reversible)
- Status tracked: pending → decided → implemented → reviewed
- Outcomes captured for learning

**Current state**: 3 decisions logged (ISR Architecture, Role-Aware Architecture, Founder Role Structure)

**Value**:
- **Institutional memory**: Know *why* decisions were made, not just *what*
- **Context preservation**: Timestamp what was known at decision time
- **Audit trail**: Governance visibility for boards, investors, regulators
- **Pattern recognition**: AI identifies decision patterns, recurring themes
- **Onboarding**: New team members understand history without archaeology

### 3. Radar — External Sensing Intelligence

**What it is**: External market intelligence filtered through your strategic context.

**How it works**:
- Scans external sources (market trends, competitor moves, regulatory changes, technology shifts)
- AI analyzes each signal against your foundation, strategies, and initiatives
- Produces contextualized implications — not generic news, but "what this means for YOUR strategy"
- Surfaces threats, opportunities, and recommended actions
- Links findings to specific strategies and decisions

**Current state**: Functional prototype demonstrated (Jan 30 AI landscape scan)

**Value**:
- **Contextualized intelligence**: Same news means different things to different companies — Radar interprets through YOUR lens
- **Strategic filtering**: Not "here's what happened" but "here's what matters to you and why"
- **Proactive surfacing**: AI flags when external events require strategic attention
- **Competitive awareness**: Track competitor moves against your positioning
- **Decision support**: External context enriches decision-making

**What makes Radar different from news aggregators**:

| News Aggregators | Stratafy Radar |
|------------------|----------------|
| Generic summaries | Implications for YOUR strategy |
| Information overload | Filtered to what matters |
| Requires manual interpretation | AI connects to your context |
| Same output for everyone | Personalized to your foundation |
| Passive consumption | Actionable recommendations |

**Demo potential**: "I ran a radar scan this morning. Here's what the AI landscape means for your Category Leadership strategy, your funding timeline, and your competitive window."

### 4. Synthesis — Learning Intelligence (Future)

**What it is**: AI-mediated connection between insights, decisions, radar signals, and outcomes.

**How it works** (planned):
- Correlate decisions with subsequent outcomes
- Surface "decisions like X tend to result in Y"
- Identify when new insights or radar signals contradict past decision rationale
- Recommend revisiting decisions based on new information
- Connect internal insights with external radar findings

**Status**: Future capability (Phase 3-4)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The loop never stops. Internal execution creates insights. External environment triggers radar alerts. Both inform decisions. Outcomes teach the system.

## The Cold-Start Moat

**Why this creates defensibility**:

1. **Data network effects**: More usage → more intelligence → more value → more usage
2. **Switching cost**: You can export data, but you can't export the learned patterns
3. **Time advantage**: A competitor starting today is 6 months of learnings behind
4. **Compounding**: The gap widens over time, not narrows
5. **Context depth**: Radar scans become more valuable as the system learns your strategic context

**Proof point**: Stratafy's own workspace has 60+ insights, 3+ logged decisions, and radar scans that produce strategy-specific implications. A new competitor would need months to accumulate equivalent intelligence about a customer's organization.

## The Four Problems This Solves

Strategic Intelligence directly addresses the Four Problems from Category Creation:

| Problem | How Strategic Intelligence Solves It |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **Context Problem** | Insights, decisions, AND radar findings ARE the context AI needs |
| **Visibility Problem** | Decision Log provides audit trail; Radar provides external visibility |
| **Freshness Problem** | Continuous capture (Insights) + continuous scanning (Radar) keeps context current |
| **Guardrails Problem** | Decisions linked to strategies constrain what's in/out of scope |

## Strategic Constraints

What this strategy constrains:

- We do NOT build intelligence features without human approval loops
- We do NOT let AI make decisions — AI informs, humans decide
- We do NOT sacrifice explainability for prediction accuracy
- We do NOT store decision context without user control
- We do NOT pursue intelligence features before core CRUD is solid
- We do NOT build synthesis before insights and decisions are proven
- We do NOT let Radar become a generic news feed — always filter through strategic context

## Key Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation |
|----|------------|------------|------------|
| A32 | Organizations will log decisions if friction is low enough | 70% | Lighthouse customer adoption |
| A33 | Decision context is valuable enough to justify capture effort | 75% | Customer feedback on retrieving past decisions |
| A34 | AI can reliably connect insights to relevant strategies | 65% | Accuracy metrics on categorization |
| A35 | Compounding intelligence creates meaningful switching cost | 70% | Churn analysis at 12+ months |
| A36 | Radar's contextualized output is significantly more valuable than generic news | 75% | Customer feedback, demo reactions |
| A37 | External intelligence filtered through strategy creates "aha moments" | 80% | Demo reactions, customer testimonials |

## Pivot Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Customers don't log decisions despite low friction | Simplify further or make capture automatic |
| Insight volume but no strategy updates | Focus on surfacing/review workflow, not capture |
| AI categorization accuracy <70% | Fall back to manual, improve training |
| No evidence of cold-start moat after 12 months | Reassess compounding thesis |
| Radar output feels generic despite context | Improve prompt engineering, add more strategic filters |
| Customers ignore Radar findings | Reduce frequency, improve signal-to-noise ratio |

## Relationship to Other Strategies

- **Parent**: Product Architecture — Cortex layer implementation
- **Sibling**: Role-Aware Strategic Intelligence — different roles interact with intelligence differently
- **Supports**: Category Creation — proves the Flywheel and cold-start moat claims
- **Supports**: Product-Market Fit — intelligence features drive stickiness
- **Enables**: Funding & Growth — "compounding intelligence" is a key pitch point
- **Enables**: GTM Channels — Radar demo is compelling for VCs (portfolio-wide scans) and advisory firms (client intelligence)

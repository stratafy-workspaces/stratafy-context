# GTM Channels

## Description
Group strategy for distribution channels where one relationship creates many deployments. These channels share a common pattern: land with the aggregator (VC firm, advisory firm), they deploy Stratafy to their portfolio/clients, creating network effects and reducing CAC.

**Channel Types:**
1. VC Firms — deploy to portfolio companies, gain portfolio visibility
2. Advisory Firms — deploy to clients post-engagement, earn revenue share

**Common Value Propositions:**
- Dashboard visibility across multiple companies
- MCP/API access to query across portfolio
- Lock-in through operational embedding
- Network effects as companies talk to each other

**Why These Channels:**
- One sale = many deployments (10-50x leverage)
- Built-in trust: companies trust their VC/advisor recommendations
- Natural onboarding: VCs already advise, advisors already do strategy work
- Social proof multiplier: "Sequoia uses Stratafy" validates for the market

**Architecture Fit:**
Role-Aware Strategic Intelligence supports this natively—same system, different views for VC partner vs portfolio CEO vs advisory firm vs their clients.

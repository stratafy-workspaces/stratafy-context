# Context transfer bottleneck framing resonates more than "execution gap" with investors

## Description
StratClaw's finding that "90% of misalignment is poor handoffs, not bad goals" suggests that framing Stratafy's pitch around the context transfer bottleneck (specific, technical, defensible) will land better with investors than the broader "strategy-execution gap" framing. This needs to be tested in the ScaleUp demo and Pieter/Knife Capital conversations before the Sequoia pitch.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Test both framings in ScaleUp demo (Feb 23), Knife Capital conversation, and Pieter meeting (March). Track which framing generates more engagement, follow-up questions, and "I have that problem" responses.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

# Context transfer bottleneck framing resonates more than strategy-execution gap

## Description
StratClaw's independent finding suggests "context transfer bottleneck" is a more precise and defensible framing than "strategy-execution gap" for Stratafy's core problem statement. Hypothesis: investors and customers will respond more strongly to "90% of misalignment is poor handoffs, not bad goals" than to the broader execution gap narrative. Needs validation through ScaleUp demo (Feb 23), Pieter meeting (March), and Sequoia pitch (April).

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: medium
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Test both framings in ScaleUp demo and Pieter meeting. Track which gets stronger reaction. A/B in content — publish articles using both frames, measure engagement.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

# StratClaw quantified claims (2-3x, 20%) need validation before pitch

## Description
StratClaw claims bidirectional execution-strategy loops make execution "evolve strategy 2-3x faster" and Decision Graveyards create "20% efficiency gains." These quantified claims are directionally compelling but unsubstantiated. If used in the Sequoia pitch without rigorous backing, they could undermine credibility. The operational patterns are real and validated; the specific numbers need measurement from STIR and ScaleUp engagements.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track concrete metrics from STIR (Feb 17+) and ScaleUp pilot: time savings from Decision Graveyard usage, strategy update frequency with vs without feedback loops. Need 4-6 weeks of data before Sequoia pitch.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

# VCs will deploy strategic tooling across their portfolios

## Description
VCs will see portfolio-wide strategic visibility as a compelling value proposition — enough to deploy Stratafy across portfolio companies and pay for it. If VCs view strategic tooling as a company-level decision (not a fund-level decision), the VC-as-customer channel collapses to VC-as-introducer only, and the "one sale = many deployments" leverage disappears.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Test with Madrona (Ted already identified context problem) and Sequoia pathway. Ask directly: would you deploy a strategic context tool to portfolio companies? Would you pay for portfolio-level visibility? Track whether interest is fund-level or referral-level.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

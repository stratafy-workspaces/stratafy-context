# Operational lock-in is achievable and creates a durable moat

## Description
Operational lock-in — where how the organisation works becomes dependent on Stratafy — is achievable and creates a stronger moat than data lock-in or feature differentiation. If organisations can easily replicate their strategic workflows in another tool or revert to slides and spreadsheets without significant friction, the moat is weaker than theorised and retention depends on continuous feature superiority instead.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: strategic
- **Impact if Wrong**: critical
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track depth of integration at lighthouse customers — how many workflows depend on Stratafy? How many roles interact with it? Ask lighthouse customers: "if Stratafy disappeared tomorrow, what would break?" If the answer is "nothing much," the lock-in thesis is failing.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

# MCP achieves broad ecosystem adoption

## Description
MCP (Model Context Protocol) will achieve broad adoption as the standard interface for AI tool integrations, making Stratafy's MCP-native architecture a strategic advantage rather than a niche bet. If MCP doesn't achieve ecosystem traction and a competitor protocol wins (e.g., OpenAI's equivalent), Stratafy's architecture requires rework and the "plug into existing tools" value proposition weakens.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track MCP adoption metrics: number of MCP-compatible tools, developer community growth, enterprise adoption announcements. Monitor competing protocols from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft. Track whether Claude Desktop / MCP clients become standard enterprise tooling.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: Anthropic actively investing in MCP. Growing ecosystem of MCP servers. Claude Desktop shipping MCP support. However, OpenAI has not yet committed to MCP and may launch a competing standard.

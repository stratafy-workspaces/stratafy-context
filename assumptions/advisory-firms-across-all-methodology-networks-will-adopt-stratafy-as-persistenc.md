# Advisory firms across all methodology networks will adopt Stratafy as persistence layer

## Description
Advisory firms delivering strategy methodologies (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard, 4DX) will adopt Stratafy as the persistence and intelligence layer beneath their existing methodology. The value proposition is not replacement but extension: between-session visibility, cross-portfolio intelligence, and AI governance readiness. Every methodology produces artifacts that drift between sessions — the OPSP, the V/TO, OKR spreadsheets, Strategy Canvases. The coach holds context in memory. Stratafy makes that context persistent, queryable, and AI-accessible. The channel model applies across all methodology networks. One advisor = many client deployments. The AI hedge angle remains relevant but the primary pitch shifts to: 'we make your methodology persist between sessions and across your portfolio.'

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Phase 1: ScaleUp Company demo (Feb 17-20) tests with Scaling Up methodology. Phase 2: If validated, approach 1-2 EOS Implementers to test cross-methodology applicability. Phase 3: Build methodology-specific onboarding templates (OPSP → Stratafy, V/TO → Stratafy, OKR → Stratafy).
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

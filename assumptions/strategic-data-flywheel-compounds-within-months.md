# Strategic data flywheel compounds within months

## Description
The flywheel effect — where accumulated strategic data (insights, decisions, assumptions, radar findings) creates compounding intelligence that increases switching costs — materialises within months of active use, not years. If the compound effect takes too long to become visible, customers churn before experiencing the moat, and the cold-start advantage thesis fails.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: likely
- **Type**: strategic
- **Impact if Wrong**: critical
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track flywheel metrics on own workspace: insight volume growth rate, decision reference frequency (are old decisions being cited?), radar finding-to-strategy link density. Measure same for lighthouse customers. Define "flywheel visible" threshold — e.g., week 8 workspace materially richer than week 1 in ways that change conversation quality.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

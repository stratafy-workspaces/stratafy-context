# 18-24 month category-creation window is real

## Description
The strategic operating system category is forming now and first movers will define it before incumbents (Microsoft, Salesforce, etc.) mobilize. This assumes: (1) incumbents are 18-24 months behind on AI-native strategy infrastructure, (2) the market will consolidate around a category leader rather than fragmenting, (3) developer/enterprise adoption patterns favor early definers. If wrong, we're either too early (market isn't ready) or too late (incumbents already building).

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: likely
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: critical
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track incumbent announcements (Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow) for strategic AI governance features. Monitor VC investment in adjacent categories. Track enterprise demand signals for AI governance/context solutions.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: AI agent adoption is accelerating (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all shipping agent frameworks). No incumbent has positioned a strategic operating system product yet. Category terms like "AI governance" and "control plane" are emerging but no one owns them.

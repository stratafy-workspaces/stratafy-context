# Enterprises will proactively seek AI governance, not just reactively

## Description
Organisations deploying AI agents will recognise the need for strategic governance before those agents cause visible harm. The alternative — that companies only seek governance after a costly AI mistake — would mean the market is reactive rather than proactive, pushing Stratafy's adoption curve out by 12-18 months and requiring incident-driven sales motions instead of value-driven ones.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: likely
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track whether prospects mention AI governance proactively or only after prompting. Monitor industry incidents where ungoverned AI caused business harm. Track regulatory developments (EU AI Act enforcement, enterprise compliance mandates) that could create pull.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: EU AI Act creating compliance pressure. Multiple high-profile AI incidents in 2025. Growing "responsible AI" budgets at enterprises. However, most companies still in experimental phase with agents — governance may feel premature to them.

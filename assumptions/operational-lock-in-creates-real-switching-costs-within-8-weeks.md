# Operational lock-in creates real switching costs within 8 weeks

## Description
The thesis that once an organization's strategy lives in Stratafy and agents consume it continuously, switching means unwinding how the org operates — not just exporting data. Needs empirical validation from STIR and ScaleUp before Sequoia pitch. Specifically: does strategic context compound measurably? Do users become dependent on the flywheel? Would switching feel like a transformation they'd have to undo? Evidence needed: STIR flywheel data (context depth, insight count, agent activity over 6-8 weeks), user testimony on workflow dependency, and demonstrated cold-start gap if a competitor tried to replicate.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: strategic
- **Impact if Wrong**: critical
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track STIR flywheel metrics weekly from Feb 17. Chart context depth, insight count, agent sessions, and decisions logged. At week 6 (late March), assess: (1) Is intelligence visibly compounding? (2) Could STIR recreate this in another tool? (3) Would they describe switching as painful? Secondary: same metrics for ScaleUp from Feb 23. Tertiary: Keet van Zyl feedback on whether portfolio-level lock-in resonates as a VC.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: Architecture supports compounding (insight hierarchy, radar findings, decision log all interconnect). Stratafy's own workspace demonstrates depth after months of use. But no external customer has yet validated that lock-in materializes in practice.

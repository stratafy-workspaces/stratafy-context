# Conversational-first interface is sufficient for early adoption

## Description
A conversational MCP-first interface is sufficient for initial product adoption — customers will engage with strategy through AI conversation rather than requiring traditional UI dashboards and forms. If buyers expect a visual product and find the conversational interface too unfamiliar or too dependent on Claude Desktop, adoption stalls regardless of the underlying value.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: likely
- **Type**: technical
- **Impact if Wrong**: critical
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Observe ScaleUp demo reaction — do they engage naturally with conversational interface or ask "where's the dashboard?" Track whether prospects request UI features before committing. Measure time-to-value in conversational onboarding vs expectation.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

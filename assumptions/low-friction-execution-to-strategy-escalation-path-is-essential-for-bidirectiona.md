# Low-friction execution-to-strategy escalation path is essential for bidirectional loop value

## Description
StratClaw's operational experience suggests that the escalation path — execution insight → strategic update — is where most tools and processes break. If Stratafy doesn't build a low-friction escalation mechanism (from agent/team member discovery to strategy amendment), the bidirectional loop promise becomes theoretical. The Daily Execution Loop's /Let's go and /Call it a day are the beginning of this, but the path from "I noticed something during execution" to "strategy is now updated" needs to be explicit, auditable, and fast. This is potentially a core differentiator if productized well.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: likely
- **Type**: strategic
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: During STIR engagement, track: (1) how many execution insights surface that should update strategy, (2) what the current friction/time cost is to make those updates, (3) whether users naturally attempt the escalation or abandon it. If friction is high, prioritize building the explicit escalation mechanism.

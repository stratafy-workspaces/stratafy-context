# StratClaw's quantified claims (2-3x faster, 20% efficiency) are substantiatable for fundraise

## Description
StratClaw claims "execution evolves strategy 2-3x faster" with bidirectional loops, and "20% efficiency gains" from Decision Graveyards. These are directionally promising but unsubstantiated claims from a single-agent experiment. If we cite these numbers in the Sequoia pitch without rigorous backing, we risk credibility with sophisticated investors who will probe methodology. Need to either: (a) substantiate with STIR/ScaleUp data by April, or (b) frame as hypotheses with qualitative evidence only.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: market
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track STIR engagement metrics from Feb 17. Measure: time to decision with vs without strategic context, frequency of re-litigated decisions before/after Decision Graveyard. If quantifiable evidence isn't available by March, downgrade to qualitative framing for pitch.
- **Validated At**: Not yet validated
- **Evidence**: No evidence recorded

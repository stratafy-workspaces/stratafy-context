# Stratafy will subsume strategy methodologies over time as users progress through adoption phases

## Description
Over a 12-24 month adoption cycle, organisations using Stratafy will progressively shift from their existing methodology (Scaling Up, EOS, OKRs, etc.) being the system of record to Stratafy being the system of record. The methodology becomes vocabulary rather than infrastructure. Progression: Phase 1 (persistence layer) → Phase 2 (intelligence value exceeds methodology tools) → Phase 3 (Stratafy is system of record, methodology is language) → Phase 4 (methodology is optional). This follows the Salesforce pattern: CRM didn't kill sales methodologies, it became the infrastructure and methodologies became optional overlays. Critical dependency: users must engage beyond Phase 2 'fancy tracker' level, which requires progressive disclosure and forcing functions.

## Assessment
- **Confidence**: hypothesis
- **Type**: strategic
- **Impact if Wrong**: high
- **Status**: active

## Validation
- **Method**: Track adoption depth in pilot customers. Measure which layers they engage with over time (foundation only → strategy tree → risks → assumptions → decisions → insights → radar). If users plateau at Phase 2 after 3 months, subsumption thesis is in question. If they naturally progress to Phase 3+ by month 6, thesis is validated. ScaleUp pilot is first data point.
